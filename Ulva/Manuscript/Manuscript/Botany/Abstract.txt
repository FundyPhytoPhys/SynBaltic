Abstract
The picocyanobacterial genus Synechococcus, one of the most abundant primary producers in marine ecosystems, comprises a diversity of strains of differing pigmentations, thriving across diverse niches. Oxygen Minimum Zones with low [O2] are expanding in both open ocean and coastal habitats. We found that PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich Synechococcus both grow under 2.5 µM [O2], characteristic of Oxygen Minimum Zones, across a range of spectral wavebands from 405 – 730 nm. The PhycoCyanin-rich strain showed generally similar chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ; d−1) under 2.5 and 250 µM [O2], whereas PhycoErythrin-rich cultures achieved faster growth rates, across the spectral bandwidths, under 2.5 µM [O2] than under 250 µM [O2]. For PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich Synechococcus, µ showed also positive linear responses to both Phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll a, and to cumulative diel PSII electron flux, although the relations vary across strain and [O2]. Electron transport downstream of Photosystem II was generally higher for both PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich strains under 250 µM [O2], since cyanobacteria show strong capacity for electron flow away from PSII to O2, particularly under excess excitation. In spite of this stronger electron transport under 250 µM [O2], the PhycoErythrin-rich strain showed a higher growth yield of electron transport under 2.5 µM [O2]. PhycoErythrin-rich Synechococcus are currently typically found at greater depths, and lower light, than are PhycoCyanin-rich strains, but we suggest that the PhycoErythrin-rich strains are actually limited to lower light by an interaction between light and full air-saturated [O2]. In expanding Oxygen Minimum Zones PhycoErythrin-rich strains will likely exploit higher light niches, across a wider spectral range.
