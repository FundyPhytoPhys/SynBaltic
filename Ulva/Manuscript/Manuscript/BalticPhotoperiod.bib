  abstract = {Cluster 5 picocyanobacteria significantly contribute to primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems. Estuarine populations are highly diverse and consist of many co-occurring strains, but their physiology remains largely understudied. In this study, we characterized 17 novel estuarine picocyanobacterial strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and pigment genes (cpcB and cpeBA) uncovered multiple estuarine and freshwater-related clusters and pigment types. Assays with five representative strains (three phycocyanin rich and two phycoerythrin rich) under temperature (10--30{$^\circ$}C), light (10--190 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1), and salinity (2--14 PSU) gradients revealed distinct growth optima and tolerance, indicating that genetic variability was accompanied by physiological diversity. Adaptability to environmental conditions was associated with differential pigment content and photosynthetic performance. Amplicon sequence variants at a coastal and an offshore station linked population dynamics with phylogenetic clusters, supporting that strains isolated in this study represent key ecotypes within the Baltic Sea picocyanobacterial community. The functional diversity found within strains with the same pigment type suggests that understanding estuarine picocyanobacterial ecology requires analysis beyond the phycocyanin and phycoerythrin divide. This new knowledge of the environmental preferences in estuarine picocyanobacteria is important for understanding and evaluating productivity in current and future ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many cyanobacteria fix atmospheric N2 only in specialised cells called heterocysts1,2. Besides containing nitrogenase2, heterocysts are distinguished biochemically from vegetative cells by their inability to evolve O2 or to perform photosystem II activities1,3,4and by a deficiency in the CO2 fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase5. These cells also lack phycobiliproteins and phycobilisomes, that are part of the major light-collecting system for the light reactions of photosynthesis1,6. The phycobilipigments, light-collecting chlorophyll a and the photochemical reaction centres constitute a photosynthetic unit (PSU)---the minimum number of pigments necessary to drive photochemistry, oxygen evolution and photosynthetic electron transport. Therefore, the PSU represents an energy generating unit. In cyanobacteria, photosynthesis, and hence the PSU, contributes both ATP and probably a strong reductant to drive nitrogen fixation8. Because of the distinct photosynthetic properties of these cells, especially in pigmentation, we have compared the functional organisation of the pigments and photochemical activity of the thylakoid membranes from vegetative and heterocyst cells of Nostoc muscorum and Anabaena cylindrica. We demonstrate that the PSU is modified during the differentiation of heterocysts to support the specialised energetic requirements of these nitrogen fixing cells.},

If there is interaction between two factors model of observations include interaction term and is called 'non-additive model' which makes interaction and non-additivity equivalent in terms of meaning. When there are several observations taken at each level combination of two variables, testing non-additivity can easily be done by usual two-way ANOVA method which cannot be used when there is only one observation per cell. For the cases with only one observation per cell, some methods have been developed starting with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test in which interaction is supposed to be the product of two factor's effects. There are other methods which are used for different structures of interaction when there is only one observation. In this paper, we review some of these tests. After presenting general methodology for the two-factor linear model with interaction effect and the general two-way ANOVA method when there are n {$>$} 1 observations per cell, we present some methods for testing non-additivity when there is only one observation per cell.

Satellite capability to detect diurnal changes in ocean color was characterized using hourly overlapping afternoon orbits of the visual infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ocean color sensor and validated with in situ observations. The monthly cycle of diurnal changes was investigated for different water masses using VIIRS overlaps. Results showed the capability of satellite observations to monitor hourly color changes in coastal regions that can be impacted by vertical movement of optical layers, in response to tides, resuspension, and river plume dispersion. The spatial variability of VIIRS diurnal changes showed the occurrence and displacement of phytoplankton blooming and decaying processes. The diurnal change in ocean color was above 20\%, which represents a 30\% change in chlorophyll-a. Seasonal changes in diurnal ocean color for different water masses suggest differences in summer and winter responses to surface processes. The diurnal changes observed using satellite ocean color can be used to define the following: surface processes associated with biological activity, vertical changes in optical depth, and advection of water masses.}

The liquid brine fraction of the ice matrix is home to a diverse array of organisms, ranging from tiny archaea to larger fish and invertebrates. These organisms can tolerate high brine salinity and low temperature but do best when conditions are milder. Thriving ice algal communities, generally dominated by diatoms, live at the ice/water interface and in recently flooded surface and interior layers, especially during spring, when temperatures begin to rise. Although protists dominate the sea ice biomass, heterotrophic bacteria are also abundant. The sea ice ecosystem provides food for a host of animals, with crustaceans being the most conspicuous. Uneaten organic matter from the ice sinks through the water column and feeds benthic ecosystems. As sea ice extent declines, ice algae likely contribute a shrinking fraction of the total amount of organic matter produced in polar waters.},

Although tetrapyrrole biosynthesis has not been characterized as extensively in cyanobacteria as in plants and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, recent studies of the biochemistry and molecular genetics of this pathway have begun to exploit the advantages of these oxygenic procaryotic organisms. The results of these studies are increasing our understanding of the biosynthetic enzyme reaction mechanisms, the physical properties of the enzymes, modes of metabolic regulation, the evolution of the pathway, and the phylogenetic relationships among cyanobacteria, other bacteria, algae, and plants. In this article, emphasis is placed on the individual enzymatic steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, the natures of substrates, reaction intermediates, and products, the physical, kinetic, and regulatory properties of the enzymes, and the identification of genes that encode the enzymes. Because of the limited amount of available information that has been directly derived from cyanobacteria, results obtained from other organisms is discussed wherever it is likely to be applicable to cyanobacteria.},

Most strikingly, red-illuminated cultures contain no measurable C-phycoerythrin and have a mean filament length about 10 times shorter than fluorescent-illuminated cultures. C-phycoerythrin behaves as a photoinducible constituent of this alga. Spectrophotometric and immunochemical procedures were devised so that C-phycoerythrin metabolism could be studied quantitatively with [14C]-phenylalanine pulse-chased cultures. Transfer of red-illuminated cultures to fluorescent light initiates C-phycoerythrin production by essentially de novo synthesis. C-phycoerythrin is not degraded to any significant extent in cultures continuously illuminated with fluorescent light. Transfer of fluorescent-illuminated cultures to red light causes an abrupt cessation of C-phycoerythrin synthesis. The C-phycoerythrin content of cultures adapting to red light decreases and subsequently becomes constant. Loss of C-phycoerythrin is not brought about by metabolic degradation, but rather by a decrease in mean filament length which is effected by transcellular breakage. In this experimental system, light influences intracellular C-phycoerythrin levels by regulating the rate of synthesis of the chromoprotein.},

  abstract = {This document represents the collective efforts of SCOR Working Group 156, `Active Chlorophyll Fluorescence for Autonomous Measurements of Global Marine Primary Productivity'. The group was established in 2019, bringing together researchers and instrument manufacturers from 10 countries and 6 continents to develop standards of best practice in the application of single turnover active chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) for phytoplankton photo-physiology and productivity measurements. We focused our efforts on single turnover ChlF methods, which are most prevalent in phytoplankton research, while recognizing that other approaches, including Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorescence, are also commonly employed with macro-algae, corals and terrestrial plants. Some of the material in this document will apply to those related measurement techniques. During the period between 2019-2022, our group worked to build consensus around best practice for the collection, analysis, interpretation and archiving of ST-ChlF data from a variety of aquatic environments. This work was aimed at facilitating wide-spread use of ST-ChlF methods by the international research community, focussing on two key objectives outlined in the Working Group's terms of reference: 1. To develop, implement and document internationally-agreed best practice for the acquisition and analysis of ST-ChlF data to retrieve photosynthetic parameters and primary productivity estimates. 2. To develop, implement and document standardised ST-ChlF data output formats and archiving approaches. As a first step towards these objectives, we published a review article (Schuback et al. 2021), outlining applications, opportunities and current limitations of ST-ChlF measurements. This highlevel review was aimed at readers wishing to apply ST-ChlF methods and interpret the resulting data in the most robust manner possible. Journal length restrictions precluded in-depth treatment of many important topics, including instrument calibration, data fitting and spectral correction. In this User Guide, we expand on the material presented by Schuback et al. (2021), providing handson guidance for both experts and new users alike. With this document, we aim to provide both a strong theoretical background for ST-ChlF methods, and a practical handbook to inform the application of these methods across a wide range of aquatic environments. We assume that readers of have a basic understanding of aquatic photosynthesis, as outlined, for example, by Falkowski and Raven (2013). This document represents the first complete version of the SCOR ST-ChlF user guide. It is being released to the international research community for a period of open consultation. We encourage comments and suggestions, which can be addressed to the working group co-chairs, Philippe Tortell and David Suggett. We expect the contents of this User Guide to evolve significantly over time, through our own efforts and with input from other experts and end-users. Revised versions of the User Guide will be posted on the Ocean Best Practices site (https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/), and interested readers are encouraged to check periodically for updates. In follow up work, we aim to further develop existing open-source software (e.g. Ryan-Keogh and Robinson, 2021) to facilitate ST-ChlF data analysis from a range of different instruments and formats. This document is intended to serve the needs of a wide range of users, from novices (first year graduate students, for example) to expert researchers with decades of experience using ST-ChlF methods. We anticipate that some readers will require only high-level information on key operational parameters needed for successful ST-ChlF measurements, while others will be interested in further exploring the underlying ideas and concepts. For this reason, the document includes appendices that provide greater detail on some topics presented in the main document. In subsequent versions of this User Guide, we aim to include linked Jupyter notebooks, with handson tutorials and data processing tools. These software tools will help facilitate the inter-comparison of measurements collected by different users and instruments, supporting the development of globally-coherent ST-ChlF data compilations.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer reactions among colored cytochromes in intact bacterial cells were monitored using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted the acquisition of accurate absorbance data in suspensions of cells that scatter light. The aerobic iron respiratory chain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was dominated by the redox status of an abundant cellular cytochrome that had an absorbance peak at 579\,nm in the reduced state. Intracellular cytochrome 579 was reduced within the time that it took to mix a suspension of the bacteria with soluble ferrous iron at pH 1.7. Steady state turnover experiments were conducted where the initial concentrations of ferrous iron were less than or equal to that of the oxygen concentration. Under these conditions, the initial absorbance spectrum of the bacterium observed under air-oxidized conditions was always regenerated from that of the bacterium observed in the presence of Fe(II). The kinetics of aerobic respiration on soluble iron by intact L. ferrooxidans conformed to the Michaelis--Menten formalism, where the reduced intracellular cytochrome 579 represented the Michaelis complex whose subsequent oxidation appeared to be the rate-limiting step in the overall aerobic respiratory process. The velocity of formation of ferric iron at any time point was directly proportional to the concentration of the reduced cytochrome 579. Further, the integral over time of the concentration of the reduced cytochrome was directly proportional to the total concentration of ferrous iron in each reaction mixture. These kinetic data obtained using whole cells were consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cytochrome 579 is an obligatory steady state intermediate in the iron respiratory chain of this bacterium. The capability of conducting visible spectroscopy in suspensions of intact cells comprises a powerful post-reductionist means to study cellular respiration in situ under physiological conditions for the organism.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry is the ultimate source of reducing power for phytoplankton primary productivity (PhytoPP). Single turnover active chlorophyll fluorometry (STAF) provides a non-intrusive method that has the potential to measure PhytoPP on much wider spatiotemporal scales than is possible with more direct methods such as 14C fixation and O2 evolved through water oxidation. Application of a STAF-derived absorption coefficient for PSII light-harvesting (aLHII) provides a method for estimating PSII photochemical flux on a unit volume basis (JVPII). Within this study, we assess potential errors in the calculation of JVPII arising from sources other than photochemically active PSII complexes (baseline fluorescence) and the package effect. Although our data show that such errors can be significant, we identify fluorescence-based correction procedures that can be used to minimize their impact. For baseline fluorescence, the correction incorporates an assumed consensus PSII photochemical efficiency for dark-adapted material. The error generated by the package effect can be minimized through the ratio of variable fluorescence measured within narrow wavebands centered at 730 nm, where the re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is minimal, and at 680 nm, where re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is maximal. We conclude that, with incorporation of these corrective steps, STAF can provide a reliable estimate of JVPII and, if used in conjunction with simultaneous satellite measurements of ocean color, could take us significantly closer to achieving the objective of obtaining reliable autonomous estimates of PhytoPP.},

This scientific roadmap identifies user needs, summarizes the current state of the art, and pinpoints major gaps in long-term objectives to deliver space-derived phytoplankton diversity data that meets the user requirements. These major gaps in using ocean color to estimate phytoplankton community structure were identified as: (a) the mismatch between satellite, in situ and model data on phytoplankton composition, (b) the lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates provided with satellite data, (c) the spectral limitation of current sensors to enable the full exploitation of backscattered sunlight, and (d) the very limited applicability of satellite algorithms determining phytoplankton composition for regional, especially coastal or inland, waters. Recommendation for actions include but are not limited to: (i) an increased communication and round-robin exercises among and within the related expert groups, (ii) the launching of higher spectrally and spatially resolved sensors, (iii) the development of algorithms that exploit hyperspectral information, and of (iv) techniques to merge and synergistically use the various streams of continuous information on phytoplankton diversity from various satellite sensors' and in situ data to ensure long-term monitoring of phytoplankton composition.},

  abstract = {The acclimated reproduction rates of 22 species of marine phytoplankton were measured at 0.01, 0.023, 0.1, and 0.23 ly/min in continuous light and in a 14: 10 h light: dark cycle. Three species that reproduced exponentially at all four light intensities in the 14: 10 LD regime did not reproduce at all in continuous light at any of the light intensities. One species, which reproduced at the two lowest light intensities in the 14: 10 LD regime, failed to reproduce at all in continuous light at any light intensity examined. Seven species reproduced more slowly in continuous light than in the 14: 10 LD regime at most or all light intensities. Four species reproduced at roughly the same rate in both light regimes. Five species reproduced more rapidly in continuous light. No general phylogenetic trend could be discerned from the responses of the species to the different light intensities or to continuous light. In general, species from coastal regions can reproduce as rapidly or more rapidly in continuous light than in a 14: 10 LD cycle, while most species from oceanic regions are harmed by continuous light. A phylogenetic trend in maximum potential reproduction rate is apparent, with diatoms being the fastest, dinoflagellates the slowest, and coccolithophores somewhat intermediate.}

  abstract = {In Lake Biwa, picocyanobacteria blooms usually occur during the summer--autumn thermal stratification period. Intriguingly, a novel bloom was detected in winter 2015--2016, in which picocyanobacterial cell density increased by one order of magnitude despite lower water temperature, suggesting the possibility that ``cold-water-preference'' species dominate in the picocyanobacterial community. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of picocyanobacteria in Lake Biwa by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the picocyanobacterial community were highly diverse in Lake Biwa, with eight Synechococcus-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in different seasons. These OTUs fell into distinct phylogenetic groups, and the majority were closely related to clusters reported previously. Notably, OTU04, detected during the winter bloom, was highly affiliated with sequences found in a variety of lakes, such as Tibetan lakes and Lake Superior, where the water bodies generally have a low trophic state and temperature, and different concentrations of total dissolved solids. Thus, we inferred that the group containing OTU04 may be a psychrotolerant lineage that is widely distributed in oligotrophic water systems with low--intermediate salinity.},

These pico-sized microorganisms are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and are known to be some of the most ancient and adaptable primary producers. Yet, it was only recently, and thanks to developments in molecular biology and in the understanding of gene sequences and genomes, that we could shed light on the depth of the connection between their evolution and the history of life on the planet. Here, we briefly review the current understanding of these small prokaryotic cells, from their physiological features to their role and dynamics in different aquatic environments, focussing particularly on the still poorly understood ability of picocyanobacteria to adapt to dark conditions. While the recent discovery of Synechococcus strains able to survive in the deep Black Sea highlights how adaptable picocyanobacteria can be, it also raises more questions---showing how much we still do not know about microbial life. Using available information from brackish Black Sea strains able to perform and survive in dark (anoxic) conditions, we illustrate how adaptation to narrow ecological niches interacts with gene evolution and metabolic capacity.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are among the oldest photoautotrophic organisms on Earth, and have contributed to shaping the planet's biogeochemistry with their significant biomass and key metabolic activities. Synechococcus, the focus of this review, is one of the prevalent genera in the order Chroococcales, common in oceans and lakes and characterized by a coccoid unicellular or microcolony morphology. The evolution of its phycobilisomes is the key of the adaptation of this tiny photosynthetic cell to different light regimes and environmental conditions. Furthermore, Synechococcus strains are widely distributed from the equator to the poles, showing an extreme adaptability to high and low temperatures. Because of their structural plasticity and ecological adaptability, these cyanobacteria are particularly interesting in the current condition of fast climate change. Moreover, picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus genus have a potentially vast impact on global cycles thanks to their significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems. As increasing abundances are predicted for this genus worldwide, and in light of the connection between cyanobacteria and global change events, a better characterization of these organisms promises important and timely ecological insights. Here, I will summarize the morphological and genetic characteristics of Synechococcus strains and their distribution in freshwater lakes, also considering its marine counterpart.},

Three cell populations were discriminated by flow cytometry: Prochlorococcus prochlorophytes, Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryotes. Prochlorococcus were the most abundant component (maximum ca 2 {\texttimes} 105 cells ml-1). Unlike previous reports, their concentration was almost constant down to roughly 100 m, with a slight maximum at the surface or near the chlorophyll maximum. Cellular chlorophyll fluorescence increased 50-fold between surface and deep populations. One distinguishing feature of the community off Hawaii was the co-occurrence near the chlorophyll maximum of at least two distinct Prochlorococcus populations with different chlorophyll and DNA contents. Throughout the year, Synechococcus abundance was two orders of magnitude lower and there was no seasonal alteration between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as observed in the northern Sargasso Sea. Synechococcus populations did not extend below 120 m and were dominated by high phycourobilin cell types. Picoeukaryote abundance was quite similar to that of Synechococcus, but these cells extended deeper in the water column. Their chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited much less depth variation than Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. Seasonal variability was small ({$<$}2- to 3-fold) for all three components of the picoplankton, not only for cell abundance but also for cellular parameters such as light scatter or pigment fluorescence. Synechococcus populations exhibited the largest seasonal changes (e.g. abundance maximum and chlorophyll fluorescence varied 3-fold). Picoplankton community structure in the Pacific Ocean appears to be distinct from previous reports for other areas. In comparing station ALOHA to the Atlantic Ocean (especially the Sargasso Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea, depth-integrated abundances of Prochlorococcus were higher, that of Synechococcus were lower, and that of picoeukaryotes were similar. We believe this structure, dominated by Prochlorococcus, may be typical for subtropical open-ocean regions.},

  abstract = {The cyanobacteria are a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis and are thought to be responsible for the oxygenation of our atmosphere. Like red algae and cryptomonads, cyanobacteria also contain phycobiliproteins (PBPs) which serve as major accessory pigments during photosynthesis. PBPs are large water-soluble supramolecular protein aggregates involved in light harvesting and can be divided broadly into three classes, viz., phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC), and allophycocyanin (APC) based on their spectral properties. PBPs have been extracted and purified from Spirulina spp., Synechococcus sp., Oscillatoria sp., etc., and produced commercially from Spirulina platensis, Anabaena sp., and Galdieria sulphuraria. Since cyanobacteria exhibit wide variations in nutrient availability, light intensity, light quality (wavelength), temperature, water activity, etc., these variations also result in altered metabolic activity of these organisms as a result of differential expression of different genes. The expression of phycobiliprotein coding genes is also accordingly modulated to adapt to a particular condition. Many workers have reported changes in phycobilisome structure and expression of cpc genes in response to light quality, light quantity, and nutrients like nitrogen, sulfur, etc. The composition and function of phycobiliproteins in cyanobacteria have also been reported to change under stress conditions. In the present paper, we have reviewed the production, purification, and regulation of cyanobacterial phycobilins including their importance in the commercial sector, as they have several applications as natural dyes in food and cosmetic industry, immunological assays, health-promoting properties, and broad range of other pharmaceutical applications.},

However, the metabolic adaptations of this genus to eddy-associated environmental changes have rarely been studied. We recovered two high-quality Synechococcus metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from eddies in the South China Sea and compared their metabolic variations using metatranscriptomic samples obtained at the same time. The two MAGs (syn-bin1 and syn-bin2) are affiliated with marine Synechococcus subclusters 5.2 (S5.2) and 5.3 (S5.3), respectively. The former exhibited a higher abundance at the surface layer, whereas the latter was more abundant in the deep euphotic layer. Further analysis indicated that syn-bin1 had a strong ability to utilize organic nutrients, which could help it to thrive in the nutrient-deprived surface water. By contrast, syn-bin2 had the genetic potential to perform chromatic acclimation, which could allow it to capture green or blue light at different depths. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis showed that syn-bin2 upregulated genes involved in the synthesis of C4 acids, photosystem II proteins, and transporters in the deep euphotic layer, which might contribute to its predominance in low-light environments. Overall, this study expands our understanding of oceanic S5.2 and S5.3 Synechococcus by revealing their metabolic adaptations to mesoscale eddies.},

In six of the species, the division rhythm persisted throughout the 3 days of constant light, suggesting endogenous control.

For example, Synechococcus is restricted to the first 100 m, whereas Prochlorococcus extends much deeper in oligotrophic waters. This is in part explained by differences in adaptation to nutrient and light regimes. However, they could also be subjected to different predation rates. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the consumption of these two picoplankters by an algivorous ciliate, Strombidium sulcatum, and a bactivorous ciliate, Uronema sp. For both ciliate species, removal rates were higher, by a factor of 3 to 10, for Synechococcus compared to Prochlorococcus when prey items were presented alone or together. The growth of the two ciliates fed Synechococcus and/or Prochlorococcus also differed. S. sulcatum grew well on both prey items, whether alone or together, whereas Uronema sp. grew slowly when fed Synechococcus and very poorly when fed Prochlorococcus either alone or with Synechococcus. Our results suggest that Prochlorococcus may be less subject to ciliate predation than Synechococcus.},

The 10-fold increase in the chlorophyll a concentration (from 0.4 to 4.0 mg/m3) during a diatom/ dinoflagellate bloom leads to a decrease in water transparency and a narrowing of the photosynthesis zone. As a consequence, the average PAR within the phytoplankton habitat layer is almost halved. A diatom/dinoflagellate bloom is accompanied by changes in the downwelling irradiance spectrum at the same PAR level (optical depths). The penetrating irradiance maximum near the bottom of the euphotic zone shifts to longer wavelengths ({\textasciitilde}550--600 nm) as compared to background conditions ({\textasciitilde}500--550 nm). The increase in diatom/dinoflagellate biomass and the concomitant change in the downwelling irradiance spectrum are accompanied by a decrease in the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigments up to about three times that under background conditions at the same optical depths. The downwelling irradiance spectrum at fixed optical depths and the ability of cells to absorb light change slightly as compared to background conditions when coccolithophores bloom.},

  abstract = {The large, sparse arrays of species counts arising in both field and experimental community studies do not lend themselves to standard statistical tests based on multivariate normality. Instead, a valid and more revealing approach uses informal display methods, such as clustering or multi-dimensional scaling ordination (MDS), based on a biologically-motivated definition of pairwise similarity of samples in terms of species composition. Formal testing methods are still required, however, to establish that real assemblage differences exist between sites, times, experimental treatments, pollution states, etc. Earlier work has described a range of Manteltype permutation or randomisation procedures, making no distributional assumptions, which are termed ANOSIM tests because of their dependence only on (rank) similarities and the analogy to one and two-way ANOVA. This paper extends these tests to cover an important practical case, previously unconsidered, that of a two-way layoutwithout replication. Such cases arise for single samples (or pseudo-replicates) taken in a baseline monitoring survey of several sites over time, or a mesocosm experiment in which ``treatments'' are replicated only once within each experimental ``block''. Significance tests are given for the overall presence of a treatment (or time) effect, based on a measure of concordance between rank similarities of samples within each block (or site); the role of the two factors can be reversed to obtain a test for block effects. As in the analogous univariate ANOVA test, the method relies on absence or relative weakness of treatment x block ``interactions''. Its scope is illustrated with data from two experimental and two field studies, involving meiofaunal communities from soft-sediment and macro-algal habitats. It is seen also to accommodate a modest derree of missing data. Whilst the failure to replicate adequately is not encouraged---a richer inference is available with genuine replication---the paper does provide a limited way forward for hypothesis testing in the absence of replicates.},

Only near-surface observations are common to both remote sensing and in situ observation, so it is critical to understand processes in the upper euphotic zone. Unfortunately, the biological principles that must be used to interpret optical variability near the sea surface are weaker than we would like, because relatively few experiments and analyses have examined bio-optical relationships under high irradiance characteristic of the upper optical depth. Special consideration of this stratum is justified, because there is good evidence that bio-optical relationships are altered near the surface: (1) the fluorescence yield from chlorophyll declines, leading to bias in the estimation of pigment from fluorometry; (2) the modeled relationship between solar-stimulated fluorescence and photosynthesis seems to deviate significantly from that presented for the lower euphotic zone; and (3) carbon-specific and cellular attenuation cross sections of phytoplankton change substantially during exposures to bright light. Even the measurement of primary productivity is problematic near the sea surface, because vertical mixing is not simulated and artifactual inhibition of photosynthesis can result. These problems can be addressed by focusing more sampling effort, experimental simulation, and analytical consideration on the upper optical depth and by shortening timescales for the measurement of marine photosynthesis. Special efforts to study near-surface processes are justified, because new bio-optical algorithms will require quantitative descriptions of the responses of phytoplankton to bright light.},

Samples were collected from five light depths within euphotic zone. The impact of hydrographical conditions and light regime on the bloom dynamics was also studied. In the periods 4 February -7 March and 13 April-30 June, ultraplankton contributed \&gt;60\% to the total primary production while net and nanoplankton dominated from 7 March to 13 April. The diatoms Skeletonema costatum, Chaetoceros compressits and C. debilis , and Rhizosolenia hebetata var. semispina made up the main part of the biomass on 21 March, 28 March and 4 April respectively. A shade adapted diatom society was located at the top of the nutricline in late June with S. costatum , Chaetoceros spp ., and Thalassiosira spp . as the dominant species. The highest assimilation number of eight for the net plankton and four for the ultraplankton were found at the depth of 32\% light intensity on 28 March and 24 May respectively. Linear relationships were found between chlorophyll a and ATP for the different size fractions with regression slopes ranging from 4.3 to 5.8. The total primary production for the period of investigation was calculated to 74 g C m -2 . Light regime and water column stability were decisive factors for the outburst of the first diatom bloom in late March. Grazing on net plankton diatoms increased during late March-early April. Changes in the longshore wind-stress component were found to be essential for the understanding of the bloom dynamics.}

  abstract = {Photosynthesis can be described by target theory. At low photon flux densities, photosynthesis is a linear function of irradiance (E), the number of reaction centers (n), their effective absorption capture cross section (o), and a quantum yield (0) . As photosynthesis becomes increasingly light saturated, an increased fraction of reaction centers close. At light saturation the maximum photosynthetic rate is given as the product of the number o f reaction centers (n) and their maximum electron transport rate (1 It). Using active fluoromctry it is possible to measure non-destructively and in real time the fraction of open or closed reaction centers under ambient irradiance conditions in situ, as well as {$<$}7 and 0 . rcan be readily calculated from knowledge of the light saturation parameter, Ek (which can be deduced in situ by active fluorescence measurements) and a. We built a pump and probe fluorometer, which is interfaced with a CTD. The instrument measures the fluorescence yield of a weak probe flash preceding (F0) and succeeding (Fnl) a saturating pump flash. Profiles of these fluorescence yields are used to derive the instantaneous rate o f gross photosynthesis in natural phytoplankton communities without any incubation. Correlations with shortterm simulated in situ radiocarbon measurements are extremely high. The average slope between photosynthesis derived from fluorescence and that measured by radiocarbon is 1.06 and corresponds to the average photosynthetic quotient. The intercept is about 12\% of the maximum radiocarbon uptake and corresponds to the average net community respiration. Profiles of photosynthesis and sections showing the variability in its composite parameters reveal a significant effect of nutrient availability on photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency in the ocean, independent of phytoplankton species composition.},

The models assess cell abundance based on temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but the individual responses to these environmental variables differ for each lineage. The models estimate global biogeographic patterns and seasonal variability of cell abundance, with maxima in the warm oligotrophic gyres of the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans and minima at higher latitudes.

Using projections of sea surface temperature as a result of increased concentration of greenhouse gases at the end of the 21st century, our niche models projected increases in cell numbers of 29\% and 14\% for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area. Thus, our global niche models suggest that oceanic microbial communities will experience complex changes as a result of projected future climate conditions. Because of the high abundances and contributions to primary production of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, these changes may have large impacts on ocean ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {The element nitrogen (N) constitutes about 5--10\% of the dry weight of a cyanobacterial cell. The purpose of this chapter is to review the assimilatory pathways which in free-living cyanobacteria lead from different extracellular N-sources to cellular N-containing components. Inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium is incorporated into glutamine and glutamate via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle. The glnA gene, encoding glutamine synthetase, has been characterized in a number of cyanobacteria. Glutamate (and glutamine) distribute N to other organic compounds by means of transaminases, and glutamate is itself a precursor of some other nitrogenous metabolites. Ammonium can be taken up from the external medium by the cyanobacterial cell, but it can also be derived from other nutrients, essentially N2, nitrate and urea. Many cyanobacteria are able to fix N2 under aerobic conditions. Strategies for protecting nitrogenase from O2 in cyanobacteria include the temporal separation of nitrogenase activity and photosynthetic O2 evolution, and in some filamentous cyanobacteria, the differentiation of heterocysts (cells specialized in N2 fixation). A detailed characterization of nif genes has only been performed in a heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium. Nitrate reduction has been found to use photosynthetically reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor, and genes encoding nitrate transport and reduction proteins have been identified and shown to constitute an operon. Some amino acids like arginine and glutamine can also contribute N to some cyanobacteria; however, urea and amino acid utilization have been poorly investigated thus far. Pathways of N assimilation in cyanobacteria are induced upon ammonium deprivation, ammonium being the preferred N source. A gene, ntcA, encoding a transcriptional regulator required for expression of proteins subjected to nitrogen control has been identified. A major theme for future research is how information about the N status of the cell is sensed and transduced to the protein(s) effecting regulation of gene expression.},

In general, the specimens reached their highest ETRmax in spring in the Lagoon, but in summer in the Mediterranean, coinciding with their maximum biomass peak. The species exhibited a dynamic photoinhibition. Except C.~compressa, they showed a lower decrease in Fv/Fm and higher recovery rates in the Mediterranean populations when exposed to high irradiance. The higher salinity and temperature of the lagoon could impair the photoprotection mechanisms. The acclimation to lagoon environments is species-specific and involves complex regulatory mechanisms. The results underline the importance of N in repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms. In general, Lagoon specimens showed higher pigment concentration. Although xanthophylls play important photo-protective and antioxidant roles, the observed trend is more likely to be explained by the higher temperatures reached in the lagoon compared to Mediterranean. Therefore the studied photosynthetic and biochemical mechanisms can be effective not only for high irradiance, but also for higher temperatures in a climate change scenario, but are highly dependent on nutrient availability.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a fluorescence, measured in situ, can be applied as a tool to estimate primary production in the ocean over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. This non-invasive technique allows for fast assessments of photo-physiological parameters in contrast to the traditional methodologies (14C uptake and O2 evolution). The main photo-physiological parameters derived by the available instruments are yields, and as such, require careful interpretation. The comprehension of the main sources of variability of the photochemical and the light absorption efficiencies in marine phytoplankton has increased in the past years, largely by studies using monospecific cultures. In natural communities, however, the development of primary production models based on chlorophyll-a fluorescence remain limited as they are simultaneously subjected to a wide range of environmental and biological factors. This study will test the hypothesis that photo-physiological models for primary production estimates can be improved when key phytoplankton features, such as the pigments composition and dominant cell size, are taking into account. The approach was to contrast the photo-physiological parameters derived from measurements in distinct oceanographic regions, as well as those derived in a specific environment with presented different nutrient concentration according to the time of sampling. In addition, we showed for monospecific cultures, how the photo-physiological parameters are quantitatively related to the production of carbon under the interactive effects of taxonomic composition and cell size. The proportions of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments present in the community were related to the bulk photochemical efficiency and the cross-section of light absorption, but varied among oceanographic regions and the depth of the water column. A parameterization of fluorescence-derived primary production rates, using four dominant size classes, was derived for natural phytoplankton communities under different nutrients conditions in a coastal environment, showing that the parameters differed among size classes above a threshold of nutrient concentration. The direct conversion rates between fluorescence-derived primary production and carbon assimilation rates, computed for two distinct phytoplankton cell sizes grown in controlled laboratorial conditions, showed that cell size strongly influences the efficiency of light absorption and photochemistry, however species-specific responses in photosynthetic energy allocation dominated the differences observed in how absorbed light is utilized to carbon assimilation, i.e., in the electron requirements for carbon assimilation. The results highlighted the importance of the tight coupling of nutrients availability and phytoplankton communities, as well as for measurements of chlorophyll-a fluorescence in the ocean and primary production models. This work presents a novel contribution to the increasing efforts to apply fluorescence-based techniques to understand and parameterize primary production estimates in marine systems, especially at highly dynamic environments.},

This process is known as chlorosis. This paper presents evidence that the degradation of phycobiliproteins is part of an acclimation process in which growing cells differentiate into non-pigmented cells able to endure long periods of starvation. The time course of degradation processes differs for various photosynthetic pigments, for photosystem I and photosystem II activities and is strongly influenced by the illumination and by the experimental conditions of nutrient deprivation. Under standard experimental conditions of combined nitrogen deprivation, three phases of the differentiation process can be defined. The first phase corresponds to the well-known phycobiliprotein degradation, in phase 2 the cells lose chlorophyll a prior to entering phase 3, the fully differentiated state, in which the cells are still able to regenerate pigmentation after the addition of nitrate to the culture. An analysis of the protein synthesis patterns by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis during nitrogen starvation indicates extensive differential gene expression, suggesting the operation of tight regulatory mechanisms.},

During autumn and beginning of winter, the abundances of picocyanobacteria remained around 103 cells ml-1. Their relative contribution to total picoplanktonic algal abundance increased from 0\% during spring/summer to 70--80\% in late autumn, as a result of a decrease in the abundance of eucaryotic picoalgae.

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria are major contributors to global oceanic primary production and exhibit a unique diversity of photosynthetic pigments, allowing them to exploit a wide range of light niches. However, the relationship between pigment content and niche partitioning has remained largely undetermined due to the lack of a single-genetic marker resolving all pigment types (PTs). Here, we developed and employed a robust method based on three distinct marker genes (cpcBA, mpeBA, and mpeW) to estimate the relative abundance of all known Synechococcus PTs from metagenomes. Analysis of the Tara Oceans dataset allowed us to reveal the global distribution of Synechococcus PTs and to define their environmental niches. Green-light specialists (PT 3a) dominated in warm, green equatorial waters, whereas blue-light specialists (PT 3c) were particularly abundant in oligotrophic areas. Type IV chromatic acclimaters (CA4-A/B), which are able to dynamically modify their light absorption properties to maximally absorb green or blue light, were unexpectedly the most abundant PT in our dataset and predominated at depth and high latitudes. We also identified populations in which CA4 might be nonfunctional due to the lack of specific CA4 genes, notably in warm high-nutrient low-chlorophyll areas. Major ecotypes within clades I--IV and CRD1 were preferentially associated with a particular PT, while others exhibited a wide range of PTs. Altogether, this study provides important insights into the ecology of Synechococcus and highlights the complex interactions between vertical phylogeny, pigmentation, and environmental parameters that shape Synechococcus community structure and evolution.}

Compared with control fish, fish exposed to CC9311 demonstrated a significant preference for the dark zone of the tank in the light--dark test, which is an indication of increased anxiety. Furthermore, fish exposed to CC9311 also had a statistically significant decrease in velocity and increase in immobility and they meandered more in comparison to control fish. There was a similar trend in velocity, immobility and meandering in fish exposed to CC9902, but there were no significant differences in behaviour or locomotion between this group and control fish. Identical results were obtained with a second batch of fish. Additionally, in this second trial we also investigated whether fish would recover after a 3\>day period in seawater without cyanobacteria. Indeed, there were no longer any significant differences in behaviour among treatments, demonstrating that the sp. CC9311-induced alteration of behaviour is reversible. These results demonstrate that blooms of specific marine Synechococcus strains can induce differential sublethal effects in fish, namely alterations light--dark preference behaviour and motility.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria have evolved a number of photosynthetic strategies by adjusting the properties of the light-harvesting pigments to cope with changes in the light environment. Nostoc flagelliforme is a terrestrial filamentous cyanobacterium that has distinct phycobilisome composition consisting of phycocyanin (PC) and allophycocyanin (APC). The photoregulation process of N. flagelliforme was explored by investigating the effects of different light colors on photosynthetic pigments, which were determined after photoautotrophic growth with red (RL), yellow (YL), green (GL), blue (BL), purple (PL) and white (WL) light of same photosynthetically active photon flux density. Compared with WL, YL, GL, BL and PL changed the amounts of pigments but did not alter the cellular ratio of PC/APC; while RL altered both the amounts and proportions of PC and APC. The observations by confocal laser scanning microscope and transmission electron microscope showed that PC, APC and chlorophyll a were distributed throughout the cells under GL, BL, PL, and WL illumination but located in the outermost layer in RL and YL-grown cells. Further study revealed that changing RL intensity would not influence the ratio of PC/APC but the distribution of pigments shifted from central cytoplasmic region to the periphery of the cells with the increase of intensity. These results implied that N. flagelliforme responded to RL by regulating the composition and location of phycobilisomes and these findings would be of importance to develop the high-efficient process of N. flagelliforme culture.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus is a cosmopolitan genus of picocyanobacteria living in the photic zone of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon. This separation was largely consistent with the phycobiliprotein composition of the different BSea strains. The majority of phycocyanin (PC)-rich Bsea strains clustered with WH5701. Remarkably, the phycoerythrin (PE)-rich strains of BSea formed an as yet unidentified cluster within the cpcBA phylogeny, distantly related to other PE-rich groups. Detailed analysis of the cpcBA operon using neighbour-net analysis indicated that the PE-rich BSea strains are probably endemic for the Baltic Sea. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained by the 16S rRNA-ITS, the cpcBA, and the concatenated 16S rRNA-ITS and cpcBA operon sequences revealed possible events of horizontal gene transfer among different Synechococcus lineages. Our results show that microdiversity is important in Synechococcus populations and that it can reflect extensive diversification of different pigmentation phenotypes into different ecological niches.},

A total of ten pigment groups were considered to represent three Phytoplankton Size Classes (PSCs, micro-, nano- and picoplankton) and seven Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs, i.e. diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, prymnesiophytes (haptophytes), pico-eukaryotes, prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.). The observed relationships between Chl-a and PSCs/PFTs were well-defined at the global scale to show that a community shift of phytoplankton at the basin and global scales is reflected by a change in Chl-a of the total community. Thus, Chl-a of the total community can be used as an index of not only phytoplankton biomass but also of their community structure. Within these relationships, we also found non-monotonic variations with Chl-a for certain pico-sized phytoplankton (pico-eukaryotes, Prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.) and nano-sized phytoplankton (Green algae, prymnesiophytes). The relationships were quantified with a least-square fitting approach in order to enable an estimation of the PFTs from Chl-a where PFTs are expressed as a percentage of the total Chl-a. The estimated uncertainty of the relationships depends on both PFT and Chl-a concentration. Maximum uncertainty of 31.8\% was found for diatoms at Chl-a = 0.49 mg m-3. However, the mean uncertainty of the relationships over all PFTs was 5.9\% over the entire Chl-a range observed in situ (0.02 \&lt; Chl-a \&lt; 4.26 mg m\&minus;3). The relationships were applied to SeaWiFS satellite Chl-a data from 1998 to 2009 to show the global climatological fields of the surface distribution of PFTs. Results show that microplankton are present in the mid and high latitudes, constituting only {\textasciitilde}10.9\% of the entire phytoplankton community in the mean field for 1998--2009, in which diatoms explain {\textasciitilde}7.5\%. Nanoplankton are ubiquitous throughout the global surface oceans, except the subtropical gyres, constituting {\textasciitilde}45.5\%, of which prymnesiophytes (haptophytes) are the major group explaining {\textasciitilde}31.7\% while green algae contribute {\textasciitilde}13.9\%. Picoplankton are dominant in the subtropical gyres, but constitute {\textasciitilde}43.6\% globally, of which prokaryotes are the major group explaining {\textasciitilde}26.5\% (Prochlorococcus sp. explaining 22.8\%), while pico-eukaryotes explain {\textasciitilde}17.2\% and are relatively abundant in the South Pacific.

Carbon-specific uptake rates equalled cell specific growth rates for a minimum of 3 h at high light intensity (636 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}). Low molecular weight (LMW) compounds were linearly labelled for up to 4 h under constant high light and accounted for nearly 70 \% of total {$^{14}$}C fixed. Chloroform-soluble (lipid) and TCA-soluble (polysaccharide) fractions were uniformly labelled for only 2 h, accounting for 9 to 15 \% of total {$^{14}$}C fixed. Under low light intensity (30 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}), the proportion of {$^{14}$}C decreased in the LMW, chloroform-soluble and TCA-soluble fractions, but increased in particulate materials relative to that occurring at high light. There was an increase in the carbon fixation rates of LMW, chloroform-soluble, and particulate fractions when these cells were re-exposed to high light; carbon partitioning into the TCA-soluble fraction was initially suppressed, but recovered within 30 to 60 min. After 2 h of alternating 30 min exposures to high and low light, cells lost the ability to maintain a carbon fixation rate at 636 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$} equivalent to that found in control cultures. Carbon fixation into LMW, chloroform-soluble, and TCA-soluble fractions under fluctuating irradiance occurred only at high light, while protein labeling was unaffected. Based on these metabolic patterns, it appears that short-term (15 to 30 min) light fluctuations in situ may have a major influence on the pattern of carbon partitioning in marine phytoplankton.}

We recently proposed the ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to reduce computing time while achieving more unbiased branch supports than SBS under mild model violations. UFBoot has been steadily adopted as an efficient alternative to SBS and other bootstrap approaches. Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets.

Two pre-acclimation regimes were used, Vita-Lite as controls (530-- 700 nm peak) and blue light as experimentals (430-- 460 nm peak) prior to the mating experiments. In blue light, an increase in the number of matings and spherical cells (spheres) produced in the life cycle was observed as the photoperiod increased. This implies that longer photoperiods of blue light are more optimal for sexual reproduction in Chloromonas sp.-D than shorter ones. Under Vita-Lite, there was a significant increase in the number of matings and spheres with the extended 20 : 4 photoperiod compared with the shorter 14 : 10 photoperiod. Under blue light, significantly more matings and spheres occurred than under Vita-Lite using the same irradiance level of 95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1 (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] of 400-- 700 nm) for the 14 : 10 and 20 : 4 photoperiods. The results of these experiments suggest that Chloromonas sp.-D, known only from the Tughill Plateau, NY, is not reproducing optimally at this site where it grows and reproduces under an approximate 14 : 10 photoperiod in early April. However, in the upper 10 cm of snow in the Tughill Plateau, a blue light irradiance level of 95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1 occurs, which is optimal for this species. When these conditions are combined with a 14 : 10 photoperiod, the Tughill Plateau appears to be sub-optimal for mating and production of spherical cells. Since Chloromonas sp.-D does not appear to have a dependence on a dark cycle, this would allow it to expand its geographical distribution. It may reproduce more optimally under blue light (95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1) with an extended photoperiod ({$>$}20 : 4 h, light:dark) in high latitude field sites such as Lake Bienville, Qu{\'e}bec, in eastern North America where other species of Chloromonas are known in snow associated with coniferous forests.

Cyanobacteria have evolved a diverse set of phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) that allow cells to respond to light in the range from {$\sim$}300nm to {$\sim$}750nm. Together with associated response regulators, these photosensory proteins control many aspects of cyanobacterial physiology and metabolism. These include far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP), complementary chromatic acclimation (CCA), low-light photoacclimation (LoLiP), photosystem content and stoichiometry (long-term adaptation), short-term acclimation (state transitions), circadian rhythm, phototaxis, photomorphogenesis/development, and cellular aggregation. This minireview highlights some discoveries concerning phytochromes and CBCRs as well as two acclimation processes that improve light harvesting and energy conversion under specific irradiance conditions: FaRLiP and CCA.}

Previous work suggested that these absorption properties of water create a series of spectral niches but the theory was still too simplified to enable prediction of the spectral niches in real aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show with a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model that the vibrational modes of the water molecule delineate five spectral niches, in the violet, blue, green, orange and red parts of the spectrum. These five niches are effectively captured by chlorophylls and phycobilin pigments of cyanobacteria and their eukaryotic descendants. Global distributions of the spectral niches are predicted by satellite remote sensing and validated with observed large-scale distribution patterns of cyanobacterial pigment types. Our findings provide an elegant explanation for the biogeographical distributions of photosynthetic pigments across the lakes and oceans of our planet.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis. Yet, most phytoplankton species are heavier than water and therefore sink. How can these sinking species persist? Somehow, the answer should lie in the turbulent motion that redisperses sinking phytoplankton over the vertical water column. Here, we show, using a reaction-advection-diffusion equation of light-limited phytoplankton, that there is a turbulence window sustaining sinking phytoplankton species in deep waters. If turbulent diffusion is too high, phytoplankton are mixed to great depths, and the depth-averaged light conditions are too low to allow net positive population growth. Conversely, if turbulent diffusion is too low, sinking phytoplankton populations end up at the ocean floor and succumb in the dark. At intermediate levels of turbulent diffusion, however, phytoplankton populations can outgrow both mixing rates and sinking rates. In this way, the reproducing population as a whole can maintain a position in the well-lit zone near the top of the water column, even if all individuals within the population have a tendency to sink. This theory unites earlier classic results by Sverdrup and Riley as well as our own recent findings and provides a new conceptual framework for the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics under the influence of mixing processes.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectrophotometry, a standard tool for quantitative analysis, suffers from two major drawbacks: lack of sensitivity and vulnerability to scattering. It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

  abstract = {Diatoms, the main eukaryotic phytoplankton of the polar marine regions, are essential for the maintenance of food chains specific to Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, and are experiencing major disturbances under current climate change. As such, it is fundamental to understand the physiological mechanisms and associated molecular basis of their endurance during the long polar night. Here, using the polar diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, we report an integrative analysis combining transcriptomic, microscopic and biochemical approaches to shed light on the strategies used to survive the polar night. We reveal that in prolonged darkness, diatom cells enter a state of quiescence with reduced metabolic and transcriptional activity, during which no cell division occurs. We propose that minimal energy is provided by respiration and degradation of protein, carbohydrate and lipid stores and that homeostasis is maintained by autophagy in prolonged darkness. We also report internal structural changes that manifest the morphological acclimation of cells to darkness, including the appearance of a large vacuole. Our results further show that immediately following a return to light, diatom cells are able to use photoprotective mechanisms and rapidly resume photosynthesis, demonstrating the remarkable robustness of polar diatoms to prolonged darkness at low temperature.},

Here, we evaluated the light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) method for its capacity to yield rapidly fluorometric parameters from 0.6~m distance. The close approximation of LIFT to conventional chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) parameters is shown under controlled conditions in spinach leaves and isolated thylakoids when electron transport was impaired by anoxic conditions or chemical inhibitors. The ChlF rise from minimum fluorescence (Fo) to maximum fluorescence induced by fast repetition rate (Fm-FRR) flashes was dominated by reduction of the primary electron acceptor in photosystem II (QA). The subsequent reoxidation of QA- was quantified using the relaxation of ChlF in 0.65~ms (Fr1) and 120~ms (Fr2) phases. Reoxidation efficiency of QA- (Fr1/Fv, where Fv~=~Fm-FRR\,-\,Fo) decreased when electron transport was impaired, while quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) showed often no significant effect. ChlF relaxations of the LIFT were similar to an independent other method. Under increasing light intensities, Fr2{$\prime$}/Fq{$\prime$} (where Fr2{$\prime$} and Fq{$\prime$} represent Fr2 and Fv in the light-adapted state, respectively) was hardly affected, whereas the operating efficiency of photosystem II (Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) decreased due to non-photochemical quenching. Fm-FRR was significantly lower than the ChlF maximum induced by multiple turnover (Fm-MT) flashes. However, the resulting Fv/Fm and Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} from both flashes were highly correlated. The LIFT method complements Fv/Fm with information about efficiency of electron transport. Measurements in situ and from a distance facilitate application in high-throughput and automated phenotyping.},

  abstract = {CO2 storage in the oceans is strongly affected by biological processes. Production of organic matter through phytoplankton photosynthesis drives CO2 sequestration, which feeds back to atmospheric CO2 and global climate. The ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 and temperature is strongly associated with changes in ocean chemistry and increasing seawater temperatures. To investigate these impacts on coastal phytoplankton under conditions predicted for the year 2100 (pCO2 elevated to 800 {\textmu}atm and +4 {$^\circ$}C temperature), three factorial experiments were conducted with natural communities sampled from the western English Channel (WEC). Elevated pCO2 increased phytoplankton biomass by up to 20-fold while elevated temperature resulted in an increase of up to 14-fold. Light-saturated photosynthetic carbon fixation rates increased {$>$} 6-fold under elevated pCO2 while an increase of up to 3-fold resulted from elevated temperature. The combined effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature reduced biomass in late summer and had no effects on biomass in the autumn with no significant effects on photosynthetic carbon fixation rates in either season. Individual treatments of elevated pCO2 and temperature resulted in near mono-specific communities: diatoms in late summer and nanophytoplankton in autumn. Combined effects of both factors resulted in the most diverse phytoplankton communities and promoted increased dinoflagellate and Synechococcus biomass at the expense of diatoms and nanophytoplankton. Elevated pCO2 alone promoted dominance of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, Phaeocystis in spring and autumn, while the combination of elevated pCO2 and temperature promoted biomass of the HAB species, Prorocentrum minimum in autumn. The results indicate that experimental simulations of year 2100 pCO2 and temperature may significantly modify phytoplankton community structure with a positive feedback on atmospheric CO2 in late summer and no change on feedback in autumn. In either scenario, no increase in phytoplankton productivity during a period of changes in bulk carbonate chemistry resulting from ongoing anthropogenic carbon uptake, may be expected to negatively influence carbon biogeochemistry in the WEC.},

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses (`flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 {$\mu$}s to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption cross-section decreased by about 40\%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of {$\sigma$}PS II, p, and the kinetics of Q-A reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energy-conversion.},

  abstract = {Cell division of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and other phytoplankton typically becomes entrained to diel light/dark cycles under laboratory conditions, with division occurring primarily during dark phases and production occurring during light phases. Under these conditions, increases in cell and biomass concentrations deviate from exponential functions on time scales {$<$} 24 h. These deviations lead to significant diel variations in common measurements of phytoplankton physiology such as cellular quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon (POC, PIC) and their production rates. Being time-dependent, only the temporal mean of the various values during the day are comparable between experiments. Deviations from exponential growth furthermore imply that increases in cell and biomass concentrations cannot be expressed by the daily growth rate {$\mu$}24 h (typically determined from daily increments in cell concentrations). Consequently, conventional calculations of production as the product of a cellular quota (e.g., POC quota) and {$\mu$}24 h are mathematically incorrect. To account for this, we here describe short-term changes in cell and biomass concentrations of fast-dividing, dilute-batch cultures of E. huxleyi grown under a diel light/dark cycle using linear regression. Based on the derived models, we present calculations for daily means of cellular quotas and production rates. Conventional (time-specific) measurements of cellular quotas and production differ from daily means by up to 65\% in our example and, under some circumstances, cause false ``effects'' of treatments. Intending to reduce errors in ecophysiological studies, we recommend determining daily means---mathematically or by adjusting the experimental setup or sampling times appropriately.},

The green microalgae examined differ in the reproduction mode. Continuous illumination stimulated the growth of B.~braunii and S.~obliquus more effectively than the growth of the microalgal species from the genus Neochloris. However, under shorter duration of light of the same intensity (12L:12D cycle), the growth of all the three species of Neochloris was stimulated. Under continuous illumination, the specific growth rate in the first phase of B.~braunii and S.~obliquus cultures was higher than the growth rate of Neochloris, whereas under the 12L:12D cycle, the specific growth rate of all the three Neochloris species was generally higher than that in B.~braunii and S.~obliquus. As a result, the light regime influenced algal biomass productivity differently. The maximum biomass productivity was obtained in B. braunii and S. obliquus cultures carried out at continuous illumination. All the Neochloris species produced biomass more efficiently at the 12L:12D cycle, which was two--threefold higher than that of B. braunii and S. obliquus.

Typically, the depth at which photosynthesis still exceeds respiration coincides with the depth at which the light intensity is attenuated to 1\% of the sea surface irradiance. The composition of the light-dependent pelagic microbiome is both a function of light availability and spectral quality, as well as the strength of the water column stratification relative to turbulent mixing. Solar radiation provides the energy source for the pelagic light-dependent microbiome. However, additional environmental factors affecting the surface layer of the ocean make this environment spatially and temporally variable. Latitude has a combined effect on photoperiod, seasonal light levels, and temperature regimes. Overall, the microbiome inhabiting the euphotic zone in the ocean is adapted to steep gradients in light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations that can occur on local spatial scales. The three main categories of microorganisms that conserve energy from sunlight are the cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae who carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, the aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (AAnPB) that perform photoheterotrophy, and proteorhodopsin-containing bacteria which synthesize ATP via a light-driven proton pump. Organisms within all three groups are taxonomically diverse and are adapted to cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions. Although the energy flow through the euphotic zone is controlled by primary producers that carry out carbon fixation via oxygenic photosynthesis, the microbiome in this layer of the ocean is additionally composed of heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and symbiotic microorganisms who interact with primary producers either in a predatory role or as nutrient recyclers.},

  abstract = {Marine phytoplankton is an essential contributor to global primary production (PP). Conventional methods to measure PP are time-consuming and the results are usually influenced by bottle effect. Radio isotope tracking methods using radioactive labels are very expensive and limited by health/safety regulations. Measuring PP through variable chlorophyll a (Chla) fluorescence based techniques is a potential cheaper, handier and safer choice. Especially its much higher temporal resolution is quite attractive. However, the regulation of the conversion factor -- the electron requirement for carbon fixation ({\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C) -- from photosynthetically produced electrons to carbon based PP, is still not fully understood, especially under fluctuating conditions which are typical in natural environments. We investigated the robustness of {\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C and the contributions of the xanthophyll cycle and alternative sinks of electron to {\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C during transient phases, through Dunaliella tertiolecta culture experiments in which the phosphorus supply was varied. Besides, we also investigated whether the theory developed to obtain absolute rates of ETRPSII by Oxborough et al. 2012 and Silsbe et al. 2015 holds under such transient phase. Our results revealed that: 1) {\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C doesn't remain stable and could increase 3-fold from a P-replete condition to a P-limited environment. 2) The roles of the xanthophyll cycle in NPQ is limited, but cyclic electron flow around PSII (or PSI) by PTOX can contribute about 50\% to electrons sink and it decreased a lot when transformed into P-limited environment. 3) The assumption used for derivations of [RCII] from sigma algorithm and optical absorption coefficient of PSII (aLHII) for the new absorption algorithm, that KR is constant, proposed by Oxborough et al. 2012 doesn't hold during fluctuating environment with different P concentrations, and the KR values we got were quite higher than the default value. Our finding points to the limitations of ETRPSII derivations, and provides more information on the conversion of photosynthetically produced electrons to carbon-based PP. More studies are required before the wide spread of Chla fluorescence in measuring primary production.},

  abstract = {As the physical environment of the Arctic Ocean shifts seasonally from ice-covered to open water, the limiting resource for phytoplankton growth shifts from light to nutrients. To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low-light, high-nutrient, ice-covered spring and the high-light, low-nutrient, ice-free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become ``primed'' for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.},

We analyzed the growth, photophysiology and composition of small, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and large, Thalassiosira punctigera, centric diatoms from temperate, coastal marine habitats, responding to a matrix of photoperiods and growth light intensities. T. pseudonana showed fastest growth rates under long photoperiods and low to moderate light intensities, while the larger T. punctigera showed fastest growth rates under short photoperiods and higher light intensities. Photosystem II function and content responded primarily to instantaneous growth light intensities during the photoperiod, while diel carbon fixation and RUBISCO content responded more to photoperiod duration than to instantaneous light intensity. Changing photoperiods caused species-specific changes in the responses of photochemical yield (e-/photon) to growth light intensity. These photophysiological variables showed complex responses to photoperiod and to growth light intensity. Growth rate also showed complex responses to photoperiod and growth light intensity. But these complex responses resolved into a close relation between growth rate and the cumulative daily generation of reductant, across the matrix of photoperiods and light intensities.},

We are facing how to overcome the dilemma on the balance between economic and environment, thus taking more efforts on green processes to meet agreement of sustainable society are urgent and crucial. The absorption of CO2 by microalgae reduces the impact of CO2 on the environment. In this study, the CO2 removal efficiency was the highest in the culture of Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 (also called blue-green algae), at 2\% CO2 to reach a value of 0.86~g-CO2/g-DCW. The main product of PCC7002 is C-phycocyanin (C-PC) which regarding to phycobilisome complex in all cyanobacterial species. A 160\% increasing C-PC was achieved in the cultivation under 100~{$\mu$}mol/m2/s light intensity, 12:12 light-period with 2\% CO2 at 30~{$^\circ$}C. The mix-culture of nitric and ammonia ions had positive effect on the cell growth and C-PC accumulation, thus realized the highest yield of 0.439~g-CPC/g-DCW. Additionally, the partial purified C-PC displayed 89\% antioxidant activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) and 11\% of superoxide free radical scavenging activity, respectively. The production of C-PC from PCC7002 reduced the CO2 emission and exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and lead ion adsorption at room temperature, which has the great potential for eco-friendly application.},

Here, we assessed the effects of N and Fe amendments on both photosynthesis and biomass of phytoplankton (including final chlorophyll a biomass and taxonomic composition) in that region. Overall, the carrying capacity of phytoplankton biomass was primarily constrained by N, and Fe was a limiting resource only near the equator where phytoplankton was co-limited by N and Fe. Positive growth responses in nutrient-receiving treatments were predominantly caused by diatoms, sometimes together with Synechococcus. The often strong stimulation of large phytoplankton in these treatments substantially modified the phytoplankton assemblage from picoplankton- to diatom-dominated, which was often accompanied by a significant increase in photosynthetic competence. This is the first report showing that phytoplankton in the tropical western North Pacific are primarily limited by N, and co-limited by Fe in some areas. We combined our results with those from comparable studies in the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean to propose a general typology that describes and predicts the long-term effects of rate-limiting N and Fe on phytoplankton final biomass and changes in community structure.}

We report fundamental differences in size distributions of marine and freshwater diatoms, with marine diatoms significantly larger than freshwater species. An evolutionary game theoretical model with empirical allometries of growth and nutrient uptake shows that these differences can be explained by nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation, nutrient fluctuations and mixed layer depth differences. Constant and pulsed phosphorus supply select for small sizes, as does constant nitrogen supply. In contrast, intermediate frequency nitrogen pulses common in the ocean select for large sizes or the evolutionarily stable coexistence of large and small sizes. Size-dependent sinking interacts with mixed layer depth (MLD) to further modulate optimal sizes, with smaller sizes selected for by strong sinking and shallow MLD. In freshwaters, widespread phosphorus limitation, together with strong sinking and shallow MLD produce size distributions with smaller range, means and upper values, compared with the ocean. Shifting patterns of nutrient limitation and mixing may alter diatom size distributions, affecting global carbon cycle and the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.}

  abstract = {Phytoplankton play a pivotal role in global biogeochemical and trophic processes and provide essential ecosystem services. However, there is still no broad consensus on how and to what extent their community composition responds to environmental variability. Here, high-frequency oceanographic and biological data collected over more than 25~years in a coastal Mediterranean site are used to shed light on the temporal patterns of phytoplankton species and assemblages in their environmental context. Because of the proximity to the coast and due to large-scale variations, environmental conditions showed variability on the short and long-term scales. Nonetheless, an impressive regularity characterised the annual occurrence of phytoplankton species and their assemblages, which translated into their remarkable stability over decades. Photoperiod was the dominant factor related to community turnover and replacement, which points at a possible endogenous regulation of biological processes associated with species-specific phenological patterns, in analogy with terrestrial plants. These results highlight the considerable stability and resistance of phytoplankton communities in response to different environmental pressures, which contrast the view of these organisms as passively undergoing changes that occur at different temporal scales in their habitat, and show how, under certain conditions, biological processes may prevail over environmental forcing.},

These light responses are linked to phylogeny and pigmentation. Marine sub-cluster 5.1A isolates with higher phycouribilin: phycoerythrobilin ratios fell toward the LLO end of the continuum, while sub-cluster 5.1B, 5.2 and estuarine Synechococcus with less phycouribilin fell toward the HLO end of the continuum. Global proteomes were highly responsive to light, with {$>$} 50\% of abundant proteins varying more than twofold between the lowest and highest irradiance. All strains downregulated phycobilisome proteins with increasing irradiance. Regulation of proteins involved in photosynthetic electron transport, carbon fixation, oxidative stress protection (superoxide dismutases) and iron and nitrogen metabolism varied among strains, as did the number of high light inducible protein (Hlip) and DNA photolyase genes in their genomes. All but one LLO strain possessed the photoprotective orange carotenoid protein (OCP). The unique combinations of light responses in each strain gives rise to distinct photophysiological phenotypes that may affect Synechococcus distributions in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, which numerically dominate vast oceanic areas, are the two most abundant oxygenic phototrophs on Earth. Although they require solar energy for photosynthesis, excess light and associated high UV radiations can induce high levels of oxidative stress that may have deleterious effects on their growth and productivity. Here, we compared the photophysiologies of the model strains Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803 grown under a bell-shaped light/dark cycle of high visible light supplemented or not with UV. Prochlorococcus exhibited a higher sensitivity to photoinactivation than Synechococcus under both conditions, as shown by a larger drop of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield at noon and different diel patterns of the D1 protein pool. In the presence of UV, the PSII repair rate was significantly depressed at noon in Prochlorococcus compared to Synechococcus. Additionally, Prochlorococcus was more sensitive than Synechococcus to oxidative stress, as shown by the different degrees of PSII photoinactivation after addition of hydrogen peroxide. A transcriptional analysis also revealed dramatic discrepancies between the two organisms in the diel expression patterns of several genes involved notably in the biosynthesis and/or repair of photosystems, light-harvesting complexes, CO2 fixation as well as protection mechanisms against light, UV, and oxidative stress, which likely translate profound differences in their light-controlled regulation. Altogether our results suggest that while Synechococcus has developed efficient ways to cope with light and UV stress, Prochlorococcus cells seemingly survive stressful hours of the day by launching a minimal set of protection mechanisms and by temporarily bringing down several key metabolic processes. This study provides unprecedented insights into understanding the distinct depth distributions and dynamics of these two picocyanobacteria in the field.},

Photosynthetic organisms have developed numerous strategies to adapt their photosynthetic apparatus to changing light conditions in order to optimise their photosynthetic yield, which is crucial for life on Earth to exist. Photosynthetic acclimation is an excellent example of the complexity of biological systems, where highly diverse processes, ranging from electron excitation over protein protonation to enzymatic processes coupling ion gradients with biosynthetic activity, interact on drastically different timescales from picoseconds to hours. Efficient functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus and its protection is paramount for efficient downstream processes, including metabolism and growth. Modern experimental techniques can be successfully integrated with theoretical and mathematical models to promote our understanding of underlying mechanisms and principles. This review aims to provide a retrospective analysis of multidisciplinary photosynthetic acclimation research carried out by members of the Marie Curie Initial Training Project, AccliPhot, placing the results in a wider context. The review also highlights the applicability of photosynthetic organisms for industry, particularly with regards to the cultivation of microalgae. It intends to demonstrate how theoretical concepts can successfully complement experimental studies broadening our knowledge of common principles in acclimation processes in photosynthetic organisms, as well as in the field of applied microalgal biotechnology.}

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms regulate their responses to many diverse stimuli in an effort to balance light harvesting with utilizable light energy for carbon fixation and growth (source--sink regulation). This balance is critical to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species that can lead to cell death. However, investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria using ensemble-based measurements remains a challenge due to population heterogeneity. Here, to address this problem, we used long-term quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modelling and genetic manipulation to visualize and analyse the growth and subcellular dynamics of individual wild-type and mutant cyanobacterial cells over multiple generations. We reveal that mechanical confinement of actively growing Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 cells leads to the physical disassociation of phycobilisomes and energetic decoupling from the photosynthetic reaction centres. We suggest that the mechanical regulation of photosynthesis is a critical failsafe that prevents cell expansion when light and nutrients are plentiful, but when space is limiting. These results imply that cyanobacteria must convert a fraction of the available light energy into mechanical energy to overcome frictional forces in the environment, providing insight into the regulation of photosynthesis and how microorganisms navigate their physical environment.},

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({\textpm}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

Chlorophyll-specific and carbon-specific absorption coefficients of the algae were monitored, allowing changes in the quantum yield for growth ({$\Phi$}{\textmu}) to be assessed. All the parameters appear to be practically unaffected by chromatic conditions, provided that the photosynthetically usable radiation (PUR) is made equal. Diatoms respond to the energy level whatever the color. Nevertheless, due to opposite influences of the modifications in the ``package'' effect and in the C : Chl a ratio ({$\Theta$}), the light-harvesting capabilities of the living carbon pool vary only weakly. Therefore the growth rate change (from 0.3 to 1.2 d-1) is essentially governed by the change in {$\Phi$}{\textmu} (from 0.01 to 0.052 mol C retained mol-1 quanta absorbed). The kinetics of the Chl-a-per-cell modification and of the {$\Phi$}{\textmu} response is rather fast (within approximately one generation). Quantum yield for growth is halved after a transfer to high irradiance; thereafter it remains low and steady. Conversely the enhanced value observed just after transfer to low irradiance is not maintained beyond 2 or 3 d; after that, {$\Phi$}{\textmu} is restored practically to its initial value.},

  abstract = {Recent studies by Morel (1978) and Platt, Sathyendranath, Caverhill and Lewis (1988) have demonstrated the relative stability of the relationship between available photosynthetic energy at the ocean surface and energy stored by algal photosynthesis, once it has been normalized with respect to the column integrated chlorophyll biomass. Therefore the cross section via a vis photosynthesis and per unit of areal chlorophyll, {$\psi\ast$}, in m2 (g Chl)-1, should be relatively stable in spite of the various environmental and trophic situations possibly encountered in the open ocean. Such an ecological or biogeochemical ``constant'' is of importance when trying to transform biomass maps (obtained from remotely sensed ocean colour data) into primary production maps. Its approximate constancy has to be understood and deserves analysis. This analysis rests on the use of the local and instantaneous growth rate equation (Kiefer and Mitchell, 1983) which has to be triply integrated with respect to wavelength, depth and time. Such an integration is, in effect, the core of a light production model which schematically includes the following steps: 1.(i) to compute as a function of the sun elevation for various days, latitudes and atmospheric conditions (aerosols, water vapour, etc.) the photosynthetic energy impinging at the ocean surface (direct and diffuse components);2.(ii) to account for the loss by reflection at the air-sea interface;3.(iii) to propagate this radiant energy (in terms of spectral scalar irradiance) throughout the water column and according to given pigment vertical profiles;4.(iv) to evaluate what part of energy is absorbed by algae within the productive column;5.(v) and finally to compute that part of absorbed energy which is stored in the form of organic carbon added to the initial biomass; this last step implies that the yield for growth be modelled as a function of the irradiance level and temperature. Sensitivity tests have been effected with respect not only to the physical parameters which can be accurately modelled, but also with respect to the physiological factors for which values and parameterisation are more uncertain. Non-linear and interactive influences cause the {$\psi\ast$} values obtained by running the model, to vary within a rather restricted range (within a factor 2, for most of the trophic and environmental conditions), which are similar to those resulting from field studies. The variability of the biomass-normalized primary production can be explained and the seasonal or zonal trends illustrated. The effect of cloudiness is also analysed. This spectral light --- photosynthesis model (a sub model in the more general study of the biomass evolution) can be used either to reproduce primary production experiments and also as a predictive tool in the oceanic carbon fixation problem. The global scale made accessible by satellite techniques requires that a climatological field of the {$\psi\ast$} parameter be produced. This can be done by operating the present model, provided that the physiological factors which intervene are sufficiently ascertained and adequately parameterised, and also provided that the vertical distibution of the algal biomass can be inferred from the partial information (restricted to the upper layer) delivered by ocean colour sensors.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to review and tentatively to interpret the optical behavior of oceanic case I waters, those waters for which phytoplankton and their derivative play a predominant role in determining their optical properties. Chlorophyll-like pigment concentration is used as the index to quantify the algal material (living and detrital), and statistical relationships between this index and the depth of the euphotic layer, the spectral values of the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, or the scattering coefficient are investigated. On the basis of these statistical relationships a pigment-dependent optical model is developed. It allows the propagation of the visible radiant energy within the ocean or the backscattered radiation from the upper layer to be predicted as a function of the local phytoplanktonic content. Other geophysical or geochemical applications are derived which concern the heating rate due to penetrating visible radiations or the rate of energy storage due to photosynthesis. The nonlinear trends observed in the algal biomass-attenuation relationships are analyzed by (1) considering the rather regular change of the living-to-detrital organic carbon ratio which seems to occur in oceanic waters ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and (2) accounting for the respective contributions of absorption (by pigmented cells) and of scattering (by all kind of particulates) in the attenuation process of radiant energy.},

Phycobiliproteins typically accounted for about 50\% total cell protein, the prevalent type being C-phycocyanin, followed by alloppycocyanin, with levels of 17 and 11\% d.wt, respectively, in some strains of Anabaena and Nostoc. C-phycoerythrin was the major pigment in several Nostoc strains, reaching 10\% d.wt. Some strains represent, therefore, excellent sources of one or more phycobiliproteins. All strains tolerated an irradiance of ca 2000 {\textmu}mol photon m-2 s-1. Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047 and Nostoc sp. (Albufera) exhibited the widest optimum range of both temperature (30--45 and 25--40 {$^\circ$}C) and pH (6.5--9.5 and 6.0--9.0) for growth, the former also showing significant salt tolerance. In an outdoor open system, productivity of cultures of two phycoerythrin-rich strains of Nostoc was over 20 g (d.wt) m-2 d-1 during summer. The growth performance of the allophycocyanin-rich Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047 in outdoor semi-continuous culture has been assessed throughout the year. Productivity values under optimized conditions ranged from 9 (winter) to 24 (summer) g (d.wt) m-2 d-1.},

PCC7002 during the lag, exponential, and stationary growth phases. Elevated pCO2 significantly stimulated growth, and enhanced the maximum cell density during the stationary phase. Under ambient pCO2 conditions, the lag phase lasted for 6 days, while elevated pCO2 shortened the lag phase to two days and extended the exponential phase by four days. The elevated pCO2 increased photosynthesis levels during the lag and exponential phases, but reduced them during the stationary phase. Moreover, the elevated pCO2 reduced the saturated growth light (Ik) and increased the light utilization efficiency ({$\alpha$}) during the exponential and stationary phases, and elevated the phycobilisome:chlorophyll a (Chl a) ratio. Furthermore, the elevated pCO2 reduced the particulate organic carbon (POC):Chl a and particulate organic nitrogen (PON):Chl a ratios during the lag and stationary phases, but enhanced them during the exponential phase. Overall, Synechococcus showed differential physiological responses to elevated pCO2 during different growth phases, thus providing insight into previous studies that focused on only the exponential phase, which may have biased the results relative to the effects of elevated pCO2 in ecology or aquaculture.},

Triplicate seawater samples were incubated with and without mitomycin C and the abundances of heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria, total viruses and infectious cyanophage were followed over 24 h. Addition of mitomycin C led to increases in total viral abundance as well as the abundance of cyanophages infecting Synechococcus strain DC2. Given typical estimates of burst size, these increases were consistent with 80\% of the heterotrophic bacteria and 0.6\% of Synechococcus cells being inducible by the addition of mitomycin C. This is the highest percentage of lysogens reported for a natural microbial community and demonstrates induction in a marine Synechococcus population. It is likely that the cyanophage production following the addition of mitomycin C was much higher than that titered against a single strain of Synechococcus; hence this estimate is a minimum. In untreated seawater samples, lytic viral production was estimated to remove ca. 27\% of the gross heterotrophic bacterial production, and a minimum of 1.0\% of the gross cyanobacterial production. Our results demonstrate very high levels of lysogeny in the heterotrophic bacterial community, outside of an oligotrophic environment, and the presence of inducible lysogens in Synechococcus spp. during a naturally occurring bloom. These data emphasize the need for further examination of the factors influencing lytic and lysogenic viral infection in natural microbial communities.}

  abstract = {The prototype light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) instrument provides continuous, minimally intrusive, high time resolution ({\textasciitilde}2\,s) assessment of photosynthetic performance in terrestrial plants from up to 2\,m. It induces a chlorophyll fluorescence transient by a series of short flashes in a saturation sequence (180 {\textasciitilde}1{$\mu$}s flashlets in {$<$}380\,{$\mu$}s) to achieve near-full reduction of the primary acceptor QA, followed by a relaxation sequence (RQA; 90 flashlets at exponentially increasing intervals over {\textasciitilde}30\,ms) to observe kinetics of QA re-oxidation. When fitted by the fast repetition rate (FRR) model (Kolber et al. 1998) the QA flash of LIFT/FRR gives smaller values for FmQA from dark adapted leaves than FmPAM from pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) assays. The ratio FmQA/FmPAM resembles the ratio of fluorescence yield at the J/P phases of the classical O-J-I-P transient and we conclude that the difference simply is due to the levels of PQ pool reduction induced by the two techniques. In a strong PAM-analogous WL pulse in the dark monitored by the QA flash of LIFT/FRR {$\varphi$}PSIIWL {$\approx$} {$\varphi$}PSIIPAM. The QA flash also tracks PQ pool reduction as well as the associated responses of ETR QA {$\rightarrow$} PQ and PQ {$\rightarrow$} PSI, the relative functional ({$\sigma$}PSII) and optical absorption (aPSII) cross-sections of PSII in situ with a time resolution of {\textasciitilde}2\,s as they relax after the pulse. It is impractical to deliver strong WL pulses at a distance in the field but a longer PQ flash from LIFT/FRR also achieves full reduction of PQ pool and delivers {$\varphi$}PSIIPQ {$\approx$} {$\varphi$}PSIIPAM to obtain PAM-equivalent estimates of ETR and NPQ at a distance. In situ values of {$\sigma$}PSII and aPSII from the QA flash with smaller antenna barley (chlorina-f2) and Arabidopsis mutants (asLhcb2--12, ch1--3 Lhcb5) are proportionally similar to those previously reported from in vitro assays. These direct measurements are further validated by changes in antenna size in response to growth irradiance. We illustrate how the QA flash facilitates our understanding of photosynthetic regulation during sun flecks in natural environments at a distance, with a time resolution of a few seconds.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton primary productivity is most commonly measured by 14C assimilation although less direct methods, such as O2 exchange, have also been employed. These methods are invasive, requiring bottle incubation for up to 24 h. As an alternative, Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) has been used, on wide temporal and spatial scales within aquatic systems, to estimate photosystem II (PSII) electron flux per unit volume (JVPSII), which generally correlates well with photosynthetic O2 evolution. A major limitation of using FRRf arises from the need to employ an independent method to determine the concentration of functional photosystem II reaction centers ([RCII]); a requirement that has prevented FRR fluorometers being used, as stand-alone instruments, for the estimation of electron transport. Within this study, we have taken a new approach to the analysis of FRRf data, based on a simple hypothesis; that under a given set of environmental conditions, the ratio of rate constants for RCII fluorescence emission and photochemistry falls within a narrow range, for all groups of phytoplankton. We present a simple equation, derived from the established FRRf algorithm, for determining [RCII] from dark FRRf data alone. We also describe an entirely new algorithm for estimating JVPSII, which does not require determination of [RCII] and is valid for a heterogeneous model of connectivity among RCIIs. Empirical supporting evidence is presented. These data are derived from FRR measurements across a diverse range of microalgae, in parallel with independent measurements of [RCII]. Possible sources of error, particularly under nutrient stress conditions, are discussed.},

Of particular value are qP, which quantifies the photochemical capacity of photosystem II, and Fv-;/Fm-;, which quantifies the extent to which photochemistry at photosystem II is limited by competition with thermal decay processes. Imaging of both qP and Fv-;/Fm-; requires measurement of Fo-; (the minimum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state), which cannot be imaged with existing systems.

We employed 8.3 m\textsuperscript{3} mesocosms with a sediment trap attached to the bottom, creating a gradient in total alkalinity (TA). The lowest point on this gradient was 2400 \&mu;mol \&middot; L\textsuperscript{-1}, which corresponded to the natural alkalinity of the environment, and the highest point was 4800 \&mu;mol \&middot; L\textsuperscript{-1}. Over the course of the 33-day experiment, the plankton community exhibited two distinct phases. In phase-I (days 5\&ndash;20), a notable decline in the photosynthetic efficiency (F\textsubscript{v}/F\textsubscript{m}) was observed. This change was accompanied by substantial reductions in the abundances of picoeukaryotes, small size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-1), and microplankton. The cell viability of picoeukaryotes, as indicated by fluorescein-di-acetate hydrolysis by cellular esterases (FDA- green fluorescence), slightly increased by the end of phase-I whilst the viability of nanoeukaryotes 1 and {$<$}em{$>$}Synechococcus spp{$<$}/em{$>$} . did not change. Reactive oxygen species levels (ROS-green fluorescence) showed no significant changes for any of the functional groups. In contrast, in phase-II (days 21\&ndash;33), a pronounced community response was observed. Increases in F\textsubscript{v}/F\textsubscript{m} in the intermediate OAE treatments of ∆900 to ∆1800 \&mu;mol \&middot; L\textsuperscript{-1 } and in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chlorophyll-c2 (Chl-c2) , fucoxanthin and divinyl-Chl-a were attributed to the emergence of blooms of large size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-2) from the genera {$<$}em{$>$}Chrysochromulina{$<$}/em{$>$}, as well as picoeukaryotes. {$<$}em{$>$}Synechococcus spp{$<$}/em{$>$}. also flourished towards the end of this phase. In parallel, we observed a total 20 \% significant change in the metaproteome of the phytoplankton community. This is considered a significant alteration in protein expression, having substantial impacts on cellular functions and the physiology of the organisms. Medium levels of ∆TA showed more upregulated and less downregulated proteins than higher ∆TA treatments. Under these conditions, cell viability significantly increased in pico and nanoeukaryotes-1 in intermediate alkalinity levels, while in {$<$}em{$>$}Synechococcus spp{$<$}/em{$>$}., nanoeukaryotes-2 and microplankton remained stable. ROS levels did not significantly change in any functional group. The pigment ratios DD+DT : FUCO, and DD+DT : Chl-a increased in medium ∆TA treatments, supporting the idea of nutrient deficiency alleviation and the absence of physiological stress. Taken all data together, this study shows that there is minimal evidence indicating a harmful impact of high alkalinity on the plankton community. The OAE treatments did not result in physiological fitness impairment, thus OAE did not cause cellular stress in the phytoplankton community studied.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

PCC 6301 grew exponentially between 20{$^\circ$}C and 38{$^\circ$}C, the growth rate decreased with decreasing temperature, and growth ceased at 15{$^\circ$}C. The rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution decreased more slowly with temperature than the growth rate, and more than 20\% of the activity at 38{$^\circ$}C remained at 15{$^\circ$}C. Oxygen evolution was rapidly inactivated at high light intensity (3 mE m-2 s-1) at 15{$^\circ$}C. Little or no loss of oxygen evolution was observed under the normal light intensity (250 {$\mu$}E m-2 s-1) for growth at 15{$^\circ$}C. The decrease in the rate of nitrate consumption by cells as a function of temperature was similar to the decrease in the growth rate. Cells could not actively take up nitrate or nitrite at 15{$^\circ$}C, although nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase were still active. These data demonstrate that growth at low temperature is not limited by a decrease in the rate of photosynthetic electron transport or by photoinhibition, but that inactivation of the nitrate/nitrite transporter limits growth at low temperature.}

In this study, the physiological properties of the long-term nitrogen-starved cells are investigated in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of maintenance of viability. Preservation of energetic homeostasis is based on a low level of residual photosynthesis; activities of photosystem II and photosystem I were approximately 0.1\% of activities of vegetatively growing cells. The low levels of photosystem I activity were measured by a novel colorimetric assay developed from the activity staining of ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Photosystem II reaction centers, as determined by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, exhibited normal properties, although the efficiency of light harvesting was significantly reduced compared with that of control cells. Long-term chlorotic cells carried out protein synthesis at a very low, but detectable level, as revealed by in vivo [35S]methionine labeling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In conjunction with the very low levels of total cellular protein contents, this implies a continuous protein turnover during chlorosis. Synthesis of components of the photosynthetic apparatus could be detected, whereas factors of the translational machinery were stringently down-regulated. Beyond the massive loss of protein during acclimation to nitrogen deprivation, two proteins that were identified as SomA and SomB accumulated due to an induced expression following nitrogen reduction.},

Prochlorococcus was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. The genus comprises specific ecotypes which are phylogenetically distinct and differ markedly in their photophysiology, allowing growth over a broad range of light and nutrient conditions within the 45{$^\circ$}N to 40{$^\circ$}S latitudinal belt that they occupy. Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are closely related, together forming a discrete picophytoplankton clade, but are distinguishable by their possession of dissimilar light-harvesting apparatuses and differences in cell size and elemental composition. Synechococcus strains have a ubiquitous oceanic distribution compared to that of Prochlorococcus strains and are characterized by phylogenetically discrete lineages with a wide range of pigmentation. In this review, we put our current knowledge of marine picocyanobacterial genomics into an environmental context and present previously unpublished genomic information arising from extensive genomic comparisons in order to provide insights into the adaptations of these marine microbes to their environment and how they are reflected at the genomic level.},

Instead of the usual three phases, i.e., lag-, log-, and stationary phase, phototrophs display four distinct phases. The extra growth phase is a phase of linear, light-limited growth that follows the exponential phase and is often ignored as being different. Results of this study demonstrate marked growth phase-dependent alterations in the photophysiology of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 between cells harvested from the exponential and the linear growth phase. Notable differences are a gradual shift in the energy transfer of the light-harvesting phycobilisomes to the photosystems and a distinct change in the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. These differences will likely affect the result of physiological studies and the efficiency of product formation of Synechocystis in biotechnological applications. Our study also demonstrates that the length of the period of exponential growth can be extended by a gradually stronger incident light intensity that matches the increase of the cell density of the culture.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are known to have unique capability of nitrogen fixation in their specialized cell known as heterocyst. However, differentiation of vegetative cell toward heterocyst reduces competitive ability of cyanobacteria because it led to a shift of energy allocation from carbon to nitrogen metabolism. Therefore, heterocyst formation is regulated to avoid the differentiation commitment due to short-term nitrogen fluctuation. Once nitrogen deficiency signal is sensed by the cyanobacteria, pattern of heterocyst formation is determined that ensures equidistance formation of heterocyst cells with about one heterocyst per ten vegetative cells. After differentiation, heterocyst provides anaerobic condition that is prerequisite for the nitrogenase complex to fix the atmospheric dinitrogen. Microoxic condition inside the heterocyst is attained by elimination of oxygen-producing photosystem II activity, increasing respiration rate, and by formation of thick heterocyst-specific exopolysaccharide and glycolipid layer. Nitrogen-fixing machinery is assembled and activated during heterocyst differentiation. The nitrogenase complex is encoded by nif gene family. Many of these genes are interrupted in the vegetative cells by interruption elements and these are excised during differentiation of heterocyst by a site-specific recombinase, leading to the activation of genes. In this chapter, we have outlined the molecular circuit of heterocyst differentiation and discussed the assembly of nitrogen-fixing machinery and role of key enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism in the cyanobacteria.},

Phytoplankton cells are entrained in the water column and are thus often exposed to rapid changes in irradiance within the upper mixed layer of the ocean. An upward fluctuation in irradiance can result in photosystem II photoinactivation exceeding counteracting repair rates through protein turnover, thereby leading to net photoinhibition of primary productivity, and potentially cell death. Here we show that the effective cross-section for photosystem II photoinactivation is conserved across the picocyanobacteria, but that their photosystem II repair capacity and protein-specific photosystem II light capture are negatively correlated and vary widely across the strains. The differences in repair rate correspond to the light and nutrient conditions that characterize the site of origin of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus isolates, and determine the upward fluctuation in irradiance they can tolerate, indicating that photoinhibition due to transient high-light exposure influences their distribution in the ocean.},

We used the strains of Synechococcus temperature ecotypes to study how light utilization has evolved in the function of temperature. The tropical Synechococcus (clade II) was unable to grow under 16 {$^\circ$}C but, at temperatures {$>$}25 {$^\circ$}C, induced very high growth rates that relied on a strong synthesis of the components of the photosynthetic machinery, leading to a large increase in photosystem cross-section and electron flux. By contrast, the Synechococcus adapted to subpolar habitats (clade I) grew more slowly but was able to cope with temperatures {$<$}10 {$^\circ$}C. We show that growth at such temperatures was accompanied by a large increase of the photoprotection capacities using the orange carotenoid protein (OCP). Metagenomic analyzes revealed that Synechococcus natural communities show the highest prevalence of the ocp genes in low-temperature niches, whereas most tropical clade II Synechococcus have lost the gene. Moreover, bioinformatic analyzes suggested that the OCP variants of the two cold-adapted Synechococcus clades I and IV have undergone evolutionary convergence through the adaptation of the molecular flexibility. Our study points to an important role of temperature in the evolution of the OCP. We, furthermore, discuss the implications of the different metabolic cost of these physiological strategies on the competitiveness of Synechococcus in a warming ocean. This study can help improve the current hypotheses and models aimed at predicting the changes in ocean carbon fluxes in response to global warming.}

They play an essential role in primary production and their domination in phytoplankton biomass is common in both oligotrophic and eutrophic waters. Their role is expected to become even more relevant with the effect of climate change. However, this group of photoautotrophic organisms still remains insufficiently recognized. Only a few works have focused in detail on the occurrence of massive blooms of picocyanobacteria, their toxicity and allelopathic activity. Filling the gap in our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the proliferation of these organisms could provide a better understanding of aquatic environments. In this review, we gathered and described recent information about allelopathic activity of picocyanobacteria and occurrence of their massive blooms in many aquatic ecosystems. We also examined the relationships between climate change and representative picocyanobacterial genera from freshwater, brackish and marine ecosystems.

However, there was also a similar tendency for BA-124 and BA-132, which demonstrated the highest concentrations of PCY cells at elevated T and PAR.

  abstract = {It is estimated that the genus Synechococcus is responsible for about 17\% of net primary production in the Global Ocean. Blooms of these organisms are observed in tropical, subtropical and even temperate zones, and they have been recorded recently even beyond the polar circle. The long-term scenarios forecast a growing expansion of Synechococcus sp. and its area of dominance. This is, among others, due to their high physiological plasticity in relation to changing environmental conditions. Three phenotypes of the genus Synechococcus sp. (Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3a) were tested in controlled laboratory conditions in order to identify their response to various irradiance (10, 55, 100 and 145 {\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1) and temperature (15, 22.5 and 30 {$^\circ$}C) conditions. The highest total pigment content per cell was recorded at 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at all temperature variants with the clear dominance of phycobilins among all the pigments. In almost every variant the highest growth rate was recorded for the Type 1. The lowest growth rates were observed, in general, for the Type 3a. However, it was recognized to be less temperature sensitive in comparison to the other two types and rather light-driven with the highest plasticity and adaptation potential. The highest amounts of carotenoids were produced by Type 2 which also showed signs of the cell stress even around 55 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at 15 {$^\circ$}C and 22.5 {$^\circ$}C. This may imply that the Type 2 is the most susceptible to higher irradiances. Picocyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. require less light intensity to achieve the maximum rate of photosynthesis than larger algae. They also tolerate a wide range of temperatures which combined together make them gain a powerful competitive advantage. Our results will provide key information for the ecohydrodynamical model development. Thus, this work would be an important link in forecasting future changes in the occurrence of these organisms in the context of global warming.},

Hollow disks of PBP trimers and hexamers are arranged into cylinders by colorless linker proteins; the cylinders are then assembled into PBS. Typical semidiscoidal PBS consists of a central core formed by three allophycocyanin cylinders and of six lateral cylinders consisting of other PBP and attached as a fan to the nucleus. The PBS number, size, and pigment composition in cyanobacteria depend on light conditions and other ambient factors. While PBSs have certain advantages compared to other antennae, these pigment-protein complexes require more energy for their biosynthesis than the chlorophyll a/b and chlorophyll a/c proteins of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {The dazzling diversity of the phytoplankton has puzzled biologists for decades1,2,3,4,5. The puzzle has been enlarged rather than solved by the progressive discovery of new phototrophic microorganisms in the oceans, including picocyanobacteria6,7, pico-eukaryotes8, and bacteriochlorophyll-based9,10,11 and rhodopsin-based phototrophic bacteria12,13. Physiological and genomic studies suggest that natural selection promotes niche differentiation among these phototrophic microorganisms, particularly with respect to their photosynthetic characteristics14,15,16. We have analysed competition for light between two closely related picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus group that we isolated from the Baltic Sea17. One of these two has a red colour because it contains the pigment phycoerythrin, whereas the other is blue-green because it contains high contents of the pigment phycocyanin. Here we report theory and competition experiments that reveal stable coexistence of the two picocyanobacteria, owing to partitioning of the light spectrum. Further competition experiments with a third marine cyanobacterium, capable of adapting its pigment composition, show that this species persists by investing in the pigment that absorbs the colour not used by its competitors. These results demonstrate the adaptive significance of divergence in pigment composition of phototrophic microorganisms, which allows an efficient utilization of light energy and favours species coexistence.},

Recent laboratory experiments showed that partitioning of white light allows stable coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria. Here, we investigate to what extent these laboratory findings can be extrapolated to natural waters. We predict from a parameterized competition model that the underwater light colour of lakes and seas provides ample opportunities for coexistence of red and green phytoplankton species. To test this prediction, we sampled picocyanobacteria of 70 aquatic ecosystems, ranging from clear blue oceans to turbid brown peat lakes. As predicted, red picocyanobacteria dominated in clear waters, whereas green picocyanobacteria dominated in turbid waters. We found widespread coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria in waters of intermediate turbidity. These field data support the hypothesis that niche differentiation along the light spectrum promotes phytoplankton biodiversity, thus providing a colourful solution to the paradox of the plankton.},

Here we compare simultaneous measurements of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II obtained from the two techniques and independent estimates of the rate of light absorption by photosystem II. We measured the light-dependencies of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) in five phytoplankters using FRR and Xe-PAM approaches. The FRR and PAM estimates were related in a non-linear fashion. At low irradiances, Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} measured using PAM fluorescence exceeded Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} measured using FRR fluorescence by about 20\%. At high irradiances, measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} from the two approaches converged. The differences in Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} reflect the distinct techniques by which FRR and PAM protocols excite PSII and are amplified when estimating electron transfer rates as a result of the irradiance term. We also found that measurements of the effective light absorption cross-section for photosystem II obtained by FRR fluorescence compared well with estimates obtained from measured light absorption and photosynthetic unit size. Finally, we compared the photon efficiency of gross oxygen evolution from measurements of gross oxygen evolution and light absorption ({$\Phi$}PO2 18) with FRR measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}. We found that measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} were highly linearly correlated, but were lower by a factor of {$\sim$}1.5, than {$\Phi$}PO2 18.},

The three-dimensional spheroidal-pore model of digital core was established based on mesoscopic mechanical theory. The constitutive relationship of different types of pore microstructure deformation was studied with Eshelby equivalent medium theory, and the effects of pore microstructure on pore volume compressibility under elastic deformation conditions of single and multiple pores of a single type and mixed types of pores were investigated. The results showed that the pore volume compressibility coefficient of digital core is closely related with porosity, pore aspect ratio and volumetric proportions of different types of pores. (1) The compressibility coefficient of prolate ellipsoidal pore is positively correlated with the pore aspect ratio, while that of oblate ellipsoidal pore is negatively correlated with the pore aspect ratio. (2) At the same mean value of pore aspect ratio satisfying Gaussian distribution, the more concentrated the range of pore aspect ratio, the higher the compressibility coefficient of both prolate and oblate ellipsoidal pores will be, and the larger the deformation under the same stress condition. (3) The pore compressibility coefficient increases with porosity. (4) At a constant porosity value, the higher the proportion of oblate ellipsoidal and spherical pores in the rock, the more easier for the rock to deform, and the higher the compressibility coefficient of the rock is, while the higher the proportion of prolate ellipsoidal pores in the rock, the more difficult it is for rock to deform, and the lower the compressibility coefficient of the rock is. By calculating pore compressibility coefficient of ten classical digital rock samples, the presented analytical elliptical-pore model based on real pore structure of digital rocks can be applied to calculation of pore volume compressibility coefficient of digital rock sample.},

  abstract = {Light fluctuations are ubiquitous, exist across multiple spatial and temporal scales, and directly affect the physiology and ecology of photoautotrophs. However, the indirect effects of light fluctuations on the sensitivity of organisms to other key environmental factors are unclear. Here, we evaluate how photoperiod regime (period of time each day where organisms receive light), a dynamic element of aquatic ecosystems, can influence the interactive effects of temperature and irradiance (intensity of light) on the growth rate of phytoplankton populations. We first completed a literature review and meta-analysis that suggests photoperiod alters the individual effects of temperature -- but not irradiance -- on algal growth rates and that highlights how few studies experimentally manipulate photoperiod, temperature and irradiance. To address this empirical gap, we conducted a set of laboratory experiments on three freshwater phytoplankton species (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris and Cryptomonas ovata). We measured performance surfaces relating growth rate to irradiance and temperature gradients for each species in constant (24:0 h of light:dark) environments. We then evaluated whether analogous surfaces measured under different photoperiods (6:18, 12:12 and 16:8 h of light:dark) and scaled by the duration of light availability could be inferred from results under constant light. For a majority of the combinations of species and photoperiods examined, photoperiod meaningfully altered the intercept and shape of performance surfaces. These differences were most pronounced under the shortest photoperiod (6:18 h light:dark), where populations underperformed expectations. Alterations to performance surfaces were non-linear and mostly structured by temperature with higher temperatures yielding higher than anticipated growth rates. Collectively, these experiments and synthesis reveal the potential for photoperiod regime to influence the effects of temperature, irradiance and their interaction on phytoplankton growth. Beyond the environmental variables and organisms presently considered, this research highlights the capacity for dynamic, abiotic variables to exert direct effects while also influencing relationships among other environmental factors.},

(CCMP 839), Pelagomonas calceolata (CCMP 1756) and Prasinomonas capsulatus (CCMP 1617) in order to collect physiological parameters for pico-phytoplankton to be utilised in Ocean Biogeochemical Climate Models. The main parameters to follow the effects of ammonium, phosphate, iron and light limitation were cell growth rates ({$\mu$}), half saturation constants for growth (Km), N, P and Fe quota (per cell or per mol C), and photochemical quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm). The nitrate and phosphate limitation experiments demonstrated that the small phytoplankton species could grow at low N and P concentrations. Km values were in the micro-molar (NH4+) and sub-micro-molar (PO43-) range. N and P quota were in the femto-molar range per cell and varied from nutrient-deplete to nutrient-replete conditions. Fv/Fm values were only adversely affected at the lowest N and P concentrations in these experiments. In the Fe limitation experiments, it was shown that all three species were adversely affected only at extremely low Fe concentrations. Iron chelating agents had to be added to force the species in Fe limitation till ultimately growth stopped. Km values with respect to dissolved Fe were in the femto-molar range. Fe quota were in the low zepto-molar (10-21 M) range per cell, and varied considerably from Fe limiting to Fe replete growth conditions. Fv/Fm values diminished only at the lowest iron concentrations. In the light limitation experiments, growth rates and photochemical quantum efficiencies were adversely affected only at irradiance levels below 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These results indicate that the pico-phytoplankton species will hardly ever be completely stopped in their growth by NH4+, PO43-, Fe or light (separately) under natural conditions.},

  abstract = {1. We studied the seasonal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in a turbid, large shallow lake during an annual period (2005--06). We relate the patterns of seston concentration (total suspended solids), phytoplankton biomass and water transparency to the seasonal pattern of incident solar radiation (I0). We also report the seasonal trends of phytoplankton primary production (PP) and photosynthesis photoinhibition due to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (I{$\beta$} and UV50). 2. We first collected empirical evidence that indicated the conditions of light limitation persisted during the study period. We found that the depth-averaged irradiance estimated for the time of the day of maximum irradiance (Imean--noon) was always lower than the measured onset of light saturation of photosynthesis (Ik). 3. We then contrasted the observations with theoretical expectations based on a light limitation scenario. The observed temporal patterns of seston concentration, both on a volume and area basis, were significantly explained by I0 (R2 = 0.39 and R2 = 0.37 respectively). The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (kdPAR) (R2 = 0.55) and the depth-averaged irradiance (Imean) (R2 = 0.66), significantly increased with the I0; while the irradiance reaching the lake bottom (Iout) significantly decreased with the incident irradiance (R2 = 0.49). However, phytoplankton biovolume maxima were not coincident with the time of the year of maximum irradiance. 4. A significant positive relationship was observed between PP estimated on an area basis and I0 (R2 = 0.51, P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, the parameters describing the photosynthetic responses to high irradiances displayed marked seasonal trends. The photosynthesis photoinhibition due to PAR as well as to UV were significantly related to incident solar radiation (PAR: R2 = 0.73; UV: R2 = 0.74). These results suggest adaptation of the phytoplankton community in response to changes in incident solar radiation.},

Through a series of batch experiments in flasks and continuous mode experiments in advanced photobioreactors, it is shown that the limiting nutrient during batch cultivation is sulfate, the depletion of which leads to ROS formation and rapid bleaching of pigments after entry into stationary phase. In continuous mode, however, the limiting nutrient is iron. Optimizing these growth conditions resulted in a so far highest growth rate of 0.16 h-1 (4.3 h doubling time), which is significantly higher than the textbook value of 0.09 h-1 (8 h doubling time).

  abstract = {Using a sampling grid of 67 stations, the influence of basin-wide and subbasin-scale circulation features on phytoplankton community composition and primary and new productions was investigated in the eastern Mediterranean during winter. Taxonomic pigments were used as size class markers of phototroph groups (picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton). Primary production rates were computed using a light photosynthesis model that makes use of the total chlorophyll a (Tchl a) concentration profile as an input variable. New production was estimated as the product of primary production by a pigment-based proxy of the {\textflorin} ratio (new production/total production). For the whole eastern Mediterranean, Tchl a concentration was 20.4 mg m-2, and estimated primary and new production were 0.27 and 0.04 g C m-2 d-1, respectively, when integrated between the surface and the depth of the productive zone (1.5 times the euphotic layer). Nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton (determined from the pigment-derived criteria) were the dominant size classes and contributed to 60 and 27\%, respectively, of Tchl a, while microphytoplankton contributed only to 13\%. Subbasin and, to a certain extent, mesoscale structures (cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres) were exceptions to this general trend. Anticyclonic gyres were characterized by low Tchl a concentrations (18.8{\textpm}4.2 mg m-2, with the lowest value being 12.4 mg m-2) and the highest picophytoplankton contribution (40\% of Tchl a). In contrast, cyclonic gyres contained the highest Tchl a concentration (40.3{\textpm}15.3 mg m-2) with the highest microphytoplankton contribution (up to 26\% of Tchl a). Observations conducted at a mesoscale in the Rhode gyre (cyclonic) region show that the core of the gyre is dominated by microphytoplankton (mainly diatoms), while adjacent areas are characterized by high chlorophyll concentration dominated by picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton. We estimate that the Rhodes gyre is a zone of enhanced new production, which is 9 times higher than that in adjacent oligotrophic areas of the Levantine basin. Our results confirm the predominance of oligotrophic conditions in the eastern Mediterranean and emphasize the role of subbasin and mesoscale dynamics in driving phytoplankton biomass and composition and, finally, biogeochemical cycling in this area.},

The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect  various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Environmental toxicology focuses on identifying and predicting impact of potentially toxic anthropogenic chemicals on biosphere at various levels of biological organization. Presently there is a significant drive to gain deeper understanding of cellular and sub-cellular mechanisms of ecotoxicity. Most notable is increased focus on elucidation of cellular-response networks, interactomes, and greater implementation of cell-based biotests using high-throughput procedures, while at the same time decreasing the reliance on standard animal models used in ecotoxicity testing. This is aimed at discovery and interpretation of molecular pathways of ecotoxicity at large scale. In this regard, the applications of cytometry are perhaps one of the most fundamental prospective analytical tools for the next generation and high-throughput ecotoxicology research. The diversity of this modern technology spans flow, laser-scanning, imaging, and more recently, Raman as well as mass cytometry. The cornerstone advantages of cytometry include the possibility of multi-parameter measurements, gating and rapid analysis. Cytometry overcomes, thus, limitations of traditional bulk techniques such as spectrophotometry or gel-based techniques that average the results from pooled cell populations or small model organisms. Novel technologies such as cell imaging in flow, laser scanning cytometry, as well as mass cytometry provide innovative and tremendously powerful capabilities to analyze cells, tissues as well as to perform in situ analysis of small model organisms. In this review, we outline cytometry as a tremendously diverse field that is still vastly underutilized and often largely unknown in environmental sciences. The main motivation of this work is to highlight the potential and wide-reaching applications of cytometry in ecotoxicology, guide environmental scientists in the technological aspects as well as popularize its broader adoption in environmental risk assessment.},

The retrieved PFTs include diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, green algae and prokaryotic phytoplankton. A previously proposed method to retrieve various phytoplankton pigments, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), is investigated and adapted to retrieve Chl-a concentrations of multiple PFTs using extensive global data sets of in situ pigment measurements and matchups with satellite OC products. The performance of the EOF-based approach is assessed and cross-validated statistically. The retrieved PFTs are compared with those derived from diagnostic pigment analysis (DPA) based on in situ pigment measurements. Results show that the approach predicts well Chl-a concentrations of most of the mentioned PFTs. The performance of the approach is, however, less accurate for prokaryotes, possibly due to their general low variability and small concentration range resulting in a weak signal which is extracted from the reflectance data and corresponding EOF modes. As a demonstration of the approach utilization, the EOF-based fitted models based on satellite reflectance products at nine bands are applied to the monthly GlobColour merged products. Climatological characteristics of the PFTs are also evaluated based on ten years of merged products (2002-2012) through inter-comparisons with other existing satellite derived products on phytoplankton composition including phytoplankton size class (PSC), SynSenPFT, OC-PFT and PHYSAT. Inter-comparisons indicate that most PFTs retrieved by our study agree well with previous corresponding PFT/PSC products, except that prokaryotes show higher Chl-a concentration in low latitudes. PFT dominance derived from our products is in general well consistent with the PHYSAT product. A preliminary experiment of the retrieval algorithm using eleven OLCI bands is applied to monthly OLCI products, showing comparable PFT distributions with those from the merged products, though the matchup data for OLCI are limited both in number and coverage. This study is to ultimately deliver satellite global PFT products for long-term continuous observation, which will be updated timely with upcoming OC data, for a comprehensive understanding of the variability of phytoplankton composition structure at a global or regional scale.},

The fitting coefficient {$\rho$} measures excitation transfer from closed PSII to remaining open PSII upon illumination, which could theoretically generate a progressive increase in {$\sigma$}PSII for the remaining open PSII. To investigate how {$\rho$} responds to illumination we grew marine phytoplankters with diverse antenna structures (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira pseudonana) under limiting or saturating growth light. Initial {$\rho$} varied with growth light in Synechococcus and Thalassiosira. With increasing actinic illumination PSII closed progressively and {$\rho$} decreased for all four taxa, in a pattern explicable as an exponential decay of {$\rho$} with increasing distance between remaining open PSII reaction centers. This light-dependent down-regulation of {$\rho$} allows the four phytoplankters to limit the effect of increasing light upon {$\sigma$}PSII. The four structurally distinct taxa showed, however, distinct rates of response of {$\rho$} to PSII closure, likely reflecting differences in the spacing or orientation among their PSII centers. Following saturating illumination recovery of {$\rho$} in darkness coincided directly with PSII re-opening in Prochlorococcus. Even after PSII had re-opened in Synechococcus a transition to State II slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Ostreococcus sustained NPQ slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Thalassiosira dark recovery of {$\rho$} was slowed, possibly by a light-induced change in PSII spacing. These patterns of {$\rho$} versus PSII closure are thus a convenient probe of comparative PSII spacings.},

Phytoplankters regulate {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$} to mitigate over- or under-excitation of Photosystem II. We used diverse phytoplankton taxa to compare short term changes in {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$} with the induction of the yield of non-photochemical quenching (YNPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence, a measure of regulated excitation dissipation. In two picocyanobacteria {$\sigma$}PSII' showed no decline upon induction of moderate YNPQ, above light levels sufficient for saturation of electron transport. In the eukaryotic chl a/b Ostreococcus and the chl a/c diatom Thalassiosira, induction of non-photochemical quenching was stronger after growth under saturating light, an acclimation attributable to increased xanthophyll cycle pigment content. Across short and longer-term light histories to induce or relax regulatory processes Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira showed proportional variations between the level of YNPQ and the down regulation of {$\sigma$}PSII'. The proportional down regulation of {$\sigma$}PSII' was, however, significantly smaller than the amplitude of YNPQ induction. For the eukaryotes we can predict changes in {$\sigma$}PSII', useful for modelling electron transport, productivity and acclimation, from measures of YNPQ, which are accessible from fluorescence yield measures that do not include {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$}. This useful relation, however, does not extend to the tested prokaryotes, possibly as a result of differential violations of the rate constant assumptions that underlie the calculated YNPQ parameter.},

The maximum reached growth rate was 0.135 h-1, which corresponds to a doubling time of 5.13 h---a growth speed never reported for Synechocystis before. Saturating red light intensity for the strain was 220--360 {$\mu$}mol(photons) m-2 s-1, and we did not observe any photoinhibition up to 660 {$\mu$}mol(photons) m-2 s-1. Synechocystis was able to grow under red light only; however, photons of wavelengths 405--585 and 670--700 nm further improved its growth. Optimal growth temperature was 35{$^\circ$}C. Below 32{$^\circ$}C, the growth rates decreased linearly with temperature coefficient (Q10) 1.70. Semicontinuous cultivation is known to be efficient for growth characterization and optimization. However, the assumption of correct growth rates calculation---culture exponential growth---is often not fulfilled. The semicontinuous setup in this study was operated as a turbidostat. Accurate online OD measurements with high time-resolution allowed fast and reliable growth rates determination. Repeating diluting frequencies (up to 18 dilutions per day) were essential for rapid growth stability evaluation. The presented setup provides improvement to previously published semicontinuous characterization strategies by decreasing experimental time requirements and maintaining the culture in exponential growth phase throughout the entire characterization procedure.},

Investigations of picophytoplankton in the central Arctic Ocean region are rare because these waters used to be completely covered with sea ice. Large, newly exposed water areas, however, appeared in the sea ice zone during the summer of 2010. This provided the first opportunity to study the Arctic picophytoplankton community in these newly open surface waters. This study focuses on the picophytoplankton in the areas near the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge and  Makarov Basin. Here, HPLC pigment analysis with CHEMTAX was used to study community populations, and 454 pyrosequencing with bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the dominant genera (species). Both Pearson correlation analysis and canonical correlation analysis were used to study the relationships between the community and environmental factors. We found chlorophyll a concentrations were low (0.05--0.39~{$\mu$}g~l-1), and picophytoplankton dominated these areas. The abundances of picophytoplankton were 1.58~{\texttimes}~106--9.47~{\texttimes}~106~cells~l-1 and made up 44--80~\% of the total chlorophyll a. Prasinophytes made up 0--88~\% of the picoplanktonic chlorophyll a with the following distributions: diatoms (2--80~\%), cyanobacteria (0--20~\%), haptophytes (4--14~\%), and dinoflagellates (2--11~\%). The dominant genera (species) in the picoeukaryotes were Pyramimonas (Pyramimonas gelidicola), Micromonas (Micromonas pusilla), and Phaeocystis.

Long and short day lengths (16:8 and 8:16 LD cycles) were also applied at the two irradiances. Growth effects of temperature and irradiance were evident in most algae tested, and there were significant interactions among treatments. Most freshwater red algae had the best growth under low irradiance, confirming the preference of freshwater red algae for low light regimens. In general there was highest growth rate in long days and low irradiance. Growth optima in relation to temperature were species-specific and also varied between low and high irradiances for the same alga. The most significant differences in pigment content were related to temperature, whereas few significant differences could be attributed to variation in irradiance and photoperiod or interactions among the three parameters. The responses were species-specific and also differed for pigments in distinct temperatures, irradiances and photoperiods in the same alga. Phycocyanin was generally more concentrated than phycoerythrin and phycobiliproteins were more concentrated than chlorophyll a. The highest total pigment contents were found in two species typical of shaded habitats: A. hermannii and C. coeruleus. The expected inverse relationship of pigment with irradiance was observed only in C. coeruleus. In general, the most favorable conditions for growth were not coincident with those with highest pigment contents.},
