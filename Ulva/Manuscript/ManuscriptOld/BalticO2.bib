  abstract = {Cluster 5 picocyanobacteria significantly contribute to primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems. Estuarine populations are highly diverse and consist of many co-occurring strains, but their physiology remains largely understudied. In this study, we characterized 17 novel estuarine picocyanobacterial strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and pigment genes (cpcB and cpeBA) uncovered multiple estuarine and freshwater-related clusters and pigment types. Assays with five representative strains (three phycocyanin rich and two phycoerythrin rich) under temperature (10--30{$^\circ$}C), light (10--190 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1), and salinity (2--14 PSU) gradients revealed distinct growth optima and tolerance, indicating that genetic variability was accompanied by physiological diversity. Adaptability to environmental conditions was associated with differential pigment content and photosynthetic performance. Amplicon sequence variants at a coastal and an offshore station linked population dynamics with phylogenetic clusters, supporting that strains isolated in this study represent key ecotypes within the Baltic Sea picocyanobacterial community. The functional diversity found within strains with the same pigment type suggests that understanding estuarine picocyanobacterial ecology requires analysis beyond the phycocyanin and phycoerythrin divide. This new knowledge of the environmental preferences in estuarine picocyanobacteria is important for understanding and evaluating productivity in current and future ecosystems.},

Filamentous cyanobacteria have additional FDPs in heterocyst cells, ensuring a microaerobic environment for the function of the nitrogenase enzyme under the light. Here, the evolution, occurrence and functional mechanisms of various FDPs in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms are discussed.},

  abstract = {High light stress results in a reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of plants. This photoinhibition is targeted to photosystem II and seems to be an inevitable consequence of the complicated redox chemistry involved in the light-driven water-plastoquinone oxidoreduction reaction. Photoinactivation leads to irreversible damage of the reaction centre of photosystem II, in particular the D1 protein. In this paper, we present evidence which indicates that the inhibition of electron transport can be initiated at both the acceptor and donor sides of photosystem II. In the former case, there is a sequential array of events leading to overreduction of the primary quinone acceptor QA. This, in turn, leads to the formation of a P680 chlorophyll triplet. The donor-side inhibition is thought to involve the accumulation of the highly oxidizing species P+680 and Tyr+z. These species will lead to oxidative damage of the D1 protein, triggering it for degradation. During acceptor-side inhibition, the protein is damaged by singlet oxygen formed via a reaction between P680 triplet and oxygen. Damaged D1 protein is degraded by a serine protease located in the photosystem II complex. Preliminary inhibition and binding studies using the classical serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate suggest that the active serine is located on a 43 kDa polypeptide. Several D1 protein digestion fragments have been identified and a cleavage site between the stromally exposed loop connecting transmembrane helices IV and V is suggested.},

  abstract = {Carbon fixation has a central role in determining cellular redox poise, increasingly understood to be a key parameter in cyanobacterial physiology. In the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus---the most abundant phototroph in the oligotrophic oceans---the carbon-concentrating mechanism is reduced to the bare essentials. Given the ability of Prochlorococcus populations to grow under a wide range of oxygen concentrations in the ocean, we wondered how carbon and oxygen physiology intersect in this minimal phototroph. Thus, we examined how CO2:O2 gas balance influenced growth and chlorophyll fluorescence in Prochlorococcus strain MED4. Under O2 limitation, per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence fell at all CO2 levels, but still permitted substantial growth at moderate and high CO2. Under CO2 limitation, we observed little growth at any O2 level, although per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence fell less sharply when O2 was available. We explored this pattern further by monitoring genome-wide transcription in cells shocked with acute limitation of CO2, O2 or both. O2 limitation produced much smaller transcriptional changes than the broad suppression seen under CO2 limitation and CO2/O2 co-limitation. Strikingly, both CO2 limitation conditions initially evoked a transcriptional response that resembled the pattern previously seen in high-light stress, but at later timepoints we observed O2-dependent recovery of photosynthesis-related transcripts. These results suggest that oxygen has a protective role in Prochlorococcus when carbon fixation is not a sufficient sink for light energy.}

Most strikingly, red-illuminated cultures contain no measurable C-phycoerythrin and have a mean filament length about 10 times shorter than fluorescent-illuminated cultures. C-phycoerythrin behaves as a photoinducible constituent of this alga. Spectrophotometric and immunochemical procedures were devised so that C-phycoerythrin metabolism could be studied quantitatively with [14C]-phenylalanine pulse-chased cultures. Transfer of red-illuminated cultures to fluorescent light initiates C-phycoerythrin production by essentially de novo synthesis. C-phycoerythrin is not degraded to any significant extent in cultures continuously illuminated with fluorescent light. Transfer of fluorescent-illuminated cultures to red light causes an abrupt cessation of C-phycoerythrin synthesis. The C-phycoerythrin content of cultures adapting to red light decreases and subsequently becomes constant. Loss of C-phycoerythrin is not brought about by metabolic degradation, but rather by a decrease in mean filament length which is effected by transcellular breakage. In this experimental system, light influences intracellular C-phycoerythrin levels by regulating the rate of synthesis of the chromoprotein.},

The pigment binding proteins associated with PSII assemble in the grana membrane into PSII supercomplexes and surrounding light harvesting complex II trimers. To understand the high efficiency of light harvesting in PSII requires quantitative insight into energy transfer and charge separation in PSII supercomplexes. We have constructed the first structure-based model of energy transfer in PSII supercomplexes. This model shows that the kinetics of light harvesting cannot be simplified to a single rate limiting step. Instead, substantial contributions arise from both excitation diffusion through the antenna pigments and transfer from the antenna to the reaction center (RC), where charge separation occurs. Because of the lack of a rate-limiting step, fitting kinetic models to fluorescence lifetime data cannot be used to derive mechanistic insight on light harvesting in PSII. This model will clarify the interpretation of chlorophyll fluorescence data from PSII supercomplexes, grana membranes, and leaves.}

Nutrient inputs, like phosphorus, were often lowered decades ago, but many aquatic ecosystems have not recovered accordingly. Therefore, restoration and future protection measures need to be founded upon insights on the nutrient demands of phytoplankton in order to limit their growth and negative impacts upon coastal water bodies. This study investigated phosphatase activity, phosphate uptake, and growth of phytoplankton in a model lagoon system at the southern Baltic Sea coast. This lagoon system is perennially dominated by {$<$}italic{$>$}Cyanobium{$<$}/italic{$>$}, a clade of picocyanobacteria which lack nitrogen fixation but which are common in brackish waters.

However, experimental phosphate-fertilizations repeated over an annual cycle increased chlorophyll concentration only when either dissolved nitrogen, or N-fixing cyanobacteria were present. In contrast to chlorophyll, particulate matter increased within a week most of the time at the observed stations, even in unfertilized samples. The difference between chlorophyll and particulate responses could be explained by chlorosis after phosphorus fertilization, as nitrogen was co-limiting. Similar findings have been described for other water bodies. This study indicates that nitrogen is co-limiting in the lagoon system, and that phosphorus input has not yet declined sufficiently.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Electron transfer reactions among colored cytochromes in intact bacterial cells were monitored using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted the acquisition of accurate absorbance data in suspensions of cells that scatter light. The aerobic iron respiratory chain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was dominated by the redox status of an abundant cellular cytochrome that had an absorbance peak at 579\,nm in the reduced state. Intracellular cytochrome 579 was reduced within the time that it took to mix a suspension of the bacteria with soluble ferrous iron at pH 1.7. Steady state turnover experiments were conducted where the initial concentrations of ferrous iron were less than or equal to that of the oxygen concentration. Under these conditions, the initial absorbance spectrum of the bacterium observed under air-oxidized conditions was always regenerated from that of the bacterium observed in the presence of Fe(II). The kinetics of aerobic respiration on soluble iron by intact L. ferrooxidans conformed to the Michaelis--Menten formalism, where the reduced intracellular cytochrome 579 represented the Michaelis complex whose subsequent oxidation appeared to be the rate-limiting step in the overall aerobic respiratory process. The velocity of formation of ferric iron at any time point was directly proportional to the concentration of the reduced cytochrome 579. Further, the integral over time of the concentration of the reduced cytochrome was directly proportional to the total concentration of ferrous iron in each reaction mixture. These kinetic data obtained using whole cells were consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cytochrome 579 is an obligatory steady state intermediate in the iron respiratory chain of this bacterium. The capability of conducting visible spectroscopy in suspensions of intact cells comprises a powerful post-reductionist means to study cellular respiration in situ under physiological conditions for the organism.},

Single turnover active chlorophyll fluorometry (STAF) provides a non-intrusive method that has the potential to measure PhytoPP on much wider spatiotemporal scales than is possible with more direct methods such as 14C fixation and O2 evolved through water oxidation. Application of a STAF-derived absorption coefficient for PSII light-harvesting (aLHII) provides a method for estimating PSII photochemical flux on a unit volume basis (JVPII). Within this study, we assess potential errors in the calculation of JVPII arising from sources other than photochemically active PSII complexes (baseline fluorescence) and the package effect. Although our data show that such errors can be significant, we identify fluorescence-based correction procedures that can be used to minimize their impact. For baseline fluorescence, the correction incorporates an assumed consensus PSII photochemical efficiency for dark-adapted material. The error generated by the package effect can be minimized through the ratio of variable fluorescence measured within narrow wavebands centered at 730 nm, where the re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is minimal, and at 680 nm, where re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is maximal. We conclude that, with incorporation of these corrective steps, STAF can provide a reliable estimate of JVPII and, if used in conjunction with simultaneous satellite measurements of ocean color, could take us significantly closer to achieving the objective of obtaining reliable autonomous estimates of PhytoPP.},

The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global- and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.}

Yet, it was only recently, and thanks to developments in molecular biology and in the understanding of gene sequences and genomes, that we could shed light on the depth of the connection between their evolution and the history of life on the planet. Here, we briefly review the current understanding of these small prokaryotic cells, from their physiological features to their role and dynamics in different aquatic environments, focussing particularly on the still poorly understood ability of picocyanobacteria to adapt to dark conditions. While the recent discovery of Synechococcus strains able to survive in the deep Black Sea highlights how adaptable picocyanobacteria can be, it also raises more questions---showing how much we still do not know about microbial life. Using available information from brackish Black Sea strains able to perform and survive in dark (anoxic) conditions, we illustrate how adaptation to narrow ecological niches interacts with gene evolution and metabolic capacity.},

We discussed phenotypic diversity of Pcy in conjunction with a genotypic approach in order to resolve whether a similar morphology also reflects a phylogenetic relationship. Microcolonies of different size (from 5 to 50 cells) constitute a gradient without a net separation from single-celled types and should be considered Pcy, as transition forms from single-cell to colonial morphotypes. The single-celled Pcy populations tend to be predominant in large, deep oligo-mesotrophic lakes, while the CPcy find optimal conditions in warmer, shallower and more nutrient rich lakes. The knowledge of Pcy diversity in pelagic and littoral zone habitats is a key to understand the dominance of certain genotypes in the water column and of their ubiquity. We devoted some paragraphs to analyse the factors (biotic and abiotic) which can influence the dynamics of the different Pcy forms and we have approached the study of their common ecology.},

Red light promotes phycocyanin-II and inhibits phycoerythrin synthesis, while green light has the opposite effect, through changes in transcription regulated by a putative green/red photoreceptor(s). The effects of CCA on photosynthesis were characterized by measuring oxygen evolution and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Cells fully acclimated to either red or green light achieve a similar photosynthetic quantum yield of oxygen evolution (light-use efficiency). Shifting acclimated cells from green to red or from red to green light caused similar 40\% drops in photosynthetic quantum yield. Therefore, full CCA significantly increases light use efficiency, which is of great importance under light-limited growth. Cells growing under red light are in state I, with very low PS II to PS I energy transfer, since red light is absorbed both by phycocyanin in the phycobilisome/PS II supracomplex and by PS I chlorophyll. Cells growing under green light are in state II, with high transfer of excitation energy from the phycobilisome/PS II supracomplex to PS I. This transfer allows green light captured by phycoerythrin to ultimately drive both PS I and PS II photochemistry.}

This flow increases rapidly under high light, which allows Synechococcus to maintain photosystem II centers largely open, even under excessive excitation. The electron flow to oxygen with increasing light accounts for the progressive discrepancy between the light response curve of measured oxygen evolution, and the light response curve of photosystem II activity estimated from fluorescence measures. In cells under anoxia this flexible electron sink is lost and photosystem II centers suffer partial closure at the growth light intensity, with closure becoming more severe under excess light. As predicted from earlier work this PSII closure results in rapid loss of psbAI message, encoding the D1:1 protein of PSII, and induction of psbAII/AIII encoding the alternate D1:2 protein. The changes in the mRNA pool are not, however, reflected at the protein level, and D1:1 remains in the thylakoid membranes. There is no accumulation of D1:2, despite some continued synthesis of other proteins. PSII closure, therefore, results in repression of psbAI and induction psbAII/AIII expression, but D1:1/D1:2 exchange is blocked by anoxia, downstream from transcription. D1:1 protein and PSII activity are quite stable under anoxia and moderate illumination. Nevertheless, upon recovery under oxygenic conditions, the existing D1:1 is lost from the membranes, resulting in a transient drop in PSII activity. This suggests that under normal conditions the cells use oxygen to facilitate preemptive turnover of D1 proteins.},

Sunlight-induced charge separation lies at the basis of the photochemical reactions and it occurs in the reaction center (RC). The RC is located in the PSII core which also contains light-harvesting complexes CP43 and CP47. The PSII core of plants is surrounded by external light-harvesting complexes (lhcs) forming supercomplexes, which together with additional external lhcs, are located in the thylakoid membrane where they perform their functions. In this paper we provide an overview of the available information on the structure and organization of pigment-protein complexes in PSII and relate this to experimental and theoretical results on excitation energy transfer (EET) and charge separation (CS). This is done for different subcomplexes, supercomplexes, PSII membranes and thylakoid membranes. Differences in experimental and theoretical results are discussed and the question is addressed how results and models for individual complexes relate to the results on larger systems. It is shown that it is still very difficult to combine all available results into one comprehensive picture.},

However, the underlying processes that governed the diversification of these microorganisms and the appearance of niche-related phenotypic traits are just starting to be elucidated. Here, by comparing 81 genomes, including 34 new {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$}, we explored the evolutionary processes that shaped the genomic diversity of picocyanobacteria. Time-calibration of a core-protein tree showed that gene gain/loss occurred at an unexpectedly low rate between the different lineages, with for instance 5.6 genes gained per million years (My) for the major {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} lineage (sub-cluster 5.1), among which only 0.71/My have been fixed in the long term. Gene content comparisons revealed a number of candidates involved in nutrient adaptation, a large proportion of which are located in genomic islands shared between either closely or more distantly related strains, as identified using an original network construction approach. Interestingly, strains representative of the different ecotypes co-occurring in phosphorus-depleted waters ({$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} clades III, WPC1, and sub-cluster 5.3) were shown to display different adaptation strategies to this limitation. In contrast, we found few genes potentially involved in adaptation to temperature when comparing cold and warm thermotypes. Indeed, comparison of core protein sequences highlighted variants specific to cold thermotypes, notably involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and the oxidative stress response, revealing that long-term adaptation to thermal niches relies on amino acid substitutions rather than on gene content variation. Altogether, this study not only deciphers the respective roles of gene gains/losses and sequence variation but also uncovers numerous gene candidates likely involved in niche partitioning of two key members of the marine phytoplankton.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus comprise a numerically and ecologically prominent phytoplankton group, playing a major role in both carbon cycling and trophic networks in all oceanic regions except in the polar oceans. Despite their high abundance in coastal areas, our knowledge of Synechococcus communities in these environments is based on only a few local studies. Here, we use the global metagenome data set of the Ocean Sampling Day (June 21st, 2014) to get a snapshot of the taxonomic composition of coastal Synechococcus communities worldwide, by recruitment on a reference database of 141 picocyanobacterial genomes, representative of the whole Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and Cyanobium diversity. This allowed us to unravel drastic community shifts over small to medium scale gradients of environmental factors, in particular along European coasts. The combined analysis of the phylogeography of natural populations and the thermophysiological characterization of eight strains, representative of the four major Synechococcus lineages (clades I to IV), also brought novel insights about the differential niche partitioning of clades I and IV, which most often co-dominate the Synechococcus community in cold and temperate coastal areas. Altogether, this study reveals several important characteristics and specificities of the coastal communities of Synechococcus worldwide. IMPORTANCE Synechococcus is the second most abundant phytoplanktonic organism on Earth, and its wide genetic diversity allowed it to colonize all the oceans except for polar waters, with different clades colonizing distinct oceanic niches. In recent years, the use of global metagenomics data sets has greatly improved our knowledge of ``who is where'' by describing the distribution of Synechococcus clades or ecotypes in the open ocean. However, little is known about the global distribution of Synechococcus ecotypes in coastal areas, where Synechococcus is often the dominant phytoplanktonic organism. Here, we leverage the global Ocean Sampling Day metagenomics data set to describe Synechococcus community composition in coastal areas worldwide, revealing striking community shifts, in particular along the coasts of Europe. As temperature appears as an important driver of the community composition, we also characterize the thermal preferenda of 8 Synechococcus strains, bringing new insights into the adaptation to temperature of the dominant Synechococcus clades.}

At light saturation the maximum photosynthetic rate is given as the product of the number o f reaction centers (n) and their maximum electron transport rate (1 It). Using active fluoromctry it is possible to measure non-destructively and in real time the fraction of open or closed reaction centers under ambient irradiance conditions in situ, as well as {$<$}7 and 0 . rcan be readily calculated from knowledge of the light saturation parameter, Ek (which can be deduced in situ by active fluorescence measurements) and a. We built a pump and probe fluorometer, which is interfaced with a CTD. The instrument measures the fluorescence yield of a weak probe flash preceding (F0) and succeeding (Fnl) a saturating pump flash. Profiles of these fluorescence yields are used to derive the instantaneous rate o f gross photosynthesis in natural phytoplankton communities without any incubation. Correlations with shortterm simulated in situ radiocarbon measurements are extremely high. The average slope between photosynthesis derived from fluorescence and that measured by radiocarbon is 1.06 and corresponds to the average photosynthetic quotient. The intercept is about 12\% of the maximum radiocarbon uptake and corresponds to the average net community respiration. Profiles of photosynthesis and sections showing the variability in its composite parameters reveal a significant effect of nutrient availability on photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency in the ocean, independent of phytoplankton species composition.},

However, it was not until the Mesozoic Era (251 to 65 million years ago) that the three principal phytoplankton clades that would come to dominate the modern seas rose to ecological prominence. In contrast to their pioneering predecessors, the dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, and diatoms all contain plastids derived from an ancestral red alga by secondary symbiosis.

The models assess cell abundance based on temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but the individual responses to these environmental variables differ for each lineage. The models estimate global biogeographic patterns and seasonal variability of cell abundance, with maxima in the warm oligotrophic gyres of the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans and minima at higher latitudes.

Using projections of sea surface temperature as a result of increased concentration of greenhouse gases at the end of the 21st century, our niche models projected increases in cell numbers of 29\% and 14\% for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area. Thus, our global niche models suggest that oceanic microbial communities will experience complex changes as a result of projected future climate conditions.

  abstract = {High light poses a threat to oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Similar to eukaryotes, cyanobacteria evolved a photoprotective mechanism, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which dissipates excess absorbed energy as heat. An orange carotenoid protein (OCP) has been implicated as a blue-green light sensor that induces NPQ in cyanobacteria. Discovered in vitro, this process involves a light-induced transformation of the OCP from its dark, orange form (OCPo) to a red, active form, however, the mechanisms of NPQ in vivo remain largely unknown. Here we show that the formation of the quenching state in vivo is a multistep process that involves both photoinduced and dark reactions. Our kinetic analysis of the NPQ process reveals that the light induced conversion of OCPo to a quenching state (OCPq) proceeds via an intermediate, non-quenching state (OCPi), and this reaction sequence can be described by a three-state kinetic model. The conversion of OCPo to OCPi is a photoinduced process with the effective absorption cross section of 4.5{\texttimes}10-3{\AA}2 at 470nm. The transition from OCPi to OCPq is a dark reaction, with the first order rate constant of {\textasciitilde}0.1s-1 at 25{$^\circ$}C and the activation energy of 21kcal/mol. These characteristics suggest that the reaction rate may be limited by cis-trans proline isomerization of Gln224--Pro225 or Pro225--Pro226, located at a loop near the carotenoid. NPQ decreases the functional absorption cross-section of Photosystem II, suggesting that formation of the quenched centers reduces the flux of absorbed energy from phycobilisomes to the reaction centers by {\textasciitilde}50\%.},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria are major contributors to global oceanic primary production and exhibit a unique diversity of photosynthetic pigments, allowing them to exploit a wide range of light niches. However, the relationship between pigment content and niche partitioning has remained largely undetermined due to the lack of a single-genetic marker resolving all pigment types (PTs). Here, we developed and employed a robust method based on three distinct marker genes (cpcBA, mpeBA, and mpeW) to estimate the relative abundance of all known Synechococcus PTs from metagenomes. Analysis of the Tara Oceans dataset allowed us to reveal the global distribution of Synechococcus PTs and to define their environmental niches. Green-light specialists (PT 3a) dominated in warm, green equatorial waters, whereas blue-light specialists (PT 3c) were particularly abundant in oligotrophic areas. Type IV chromatic acclimaters (CA4-A/B), which are able to dynamically modify their light absorption properties to maximally absorb green or blue light, were unexpectedly the most abundant PT in our dataset and predominated at depth and high latitudes. We also identified populations in which CA4 might be nonfunctional due to the lack of specific CA4 genes, notably in warm high-nutrient low-chlorophyll areas. Major ecotypes within clades I--IV and CRD1 were preferentially associated with a particular PT, while others exhibited a wide range of PTs. Altogether, this study provides important insights into the ecology of Synechococcus and highlights the complex interactions between vertical phylogeny, pigmentation, and environmental parameters that shape Synechococcus community structure and evolution.}

We modulated electron transfer rate and light intensity independently of each other in lincomycin-treated pea leaves and in isolated thylakoids, in order to elucidate the specific effects of light and PSII electron transport on photoinhibition. Major changes in the rate of electron transport caused only small changes in the rate of photoinhibition, suggesting the existence of a significant photoinhibitory pathway that contains an electron-transfer-independent phase. We compared the action spectrum of photoinhibition with absorption spectra of PSII components that could function as photoreceptors of the electron-transfer-independent phase of photoinhibition and found that the absorption spectra of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) compounds resemble the action spectrum of photoinhibition, showing a steep decrease from UV-C to blue light and a low visible-light tail. Our results show that the release of a Mn ion to the thylakoid lumen is the earliest detectable step of both UV- and visible-light-induced photoinhibition. After Mn release from the oxygen-evolving complex, oxidative damage to the PSII reaction center occurs because the Mn-depleted oxygen-evolving complex cannot reduce P680+ normally.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus is a cosmopolitan genus of picocyanobacteria living in the photic zone of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon. This separation was largely consistent with the phycobiliprotein composition of the different BSea strains. The majority of phycocyanin (PC)-rich Bsea strains clustered with WH5701. Remarkably, the phycoerythrin (PE)-rich strains of BSea formed an as yet unidentified cluster within the cpcBA phylogeny, distantly related to other PE-rich groups. Detailed analysis of the cpcBA operon using neighbour-net analysis indicated that the PE-rich BSea strains are probably endemic for the Baltic Sea. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained by the 16S rRNA-ITS, the cpcBA, and the concatenated 16S rRNA-ITS and cpcBA operon sequences revealed possible events of horizontal gene transfer among different Synechococcus lineages. Our results show that microdiversity is important in Synechococcus populations and that it can reflect extensive diversification of different pigmentation phenotypes into different ecological niches.}

  abstract = {Assessing phytoplankton productivity over space and time remains a core goal for oceanographers and limnologists. Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) provides a potential means to realize this goal with unprecedented resolution and scale yet has not become the ``go-to'' method despite high expectations. A major obstacle is difficulty converting electron transfer rates to equivalent rates of C-fixation most relevant for studies of biogeochemical C-fluxes. Such difficulty stems from methodological inconsistencies and our limited understanding of how the electron requirement for C-fixation ({$\Phi$}e,C) is influenced by the environment and by differences in the composition and physiology of phytoplankton assemblages. We outline a ``roadmap'' for limiting methodological bias and to develop a more mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiology underlying {$\Phi$}e,C. We 1) re-evaluate core physiological processes governing how microalgae invest photosynthetic electron transport-derived energy and reductant into stored carbon versus alternative sinks. Then, we 2) outline steps to facilitate broader uptake and exploitation of FRRf, which could transform our knowledge of aquatic primary productivity. We argue it is time to 3) revise our historic methodological focus on carbon as the currency of choice, to 4) better appreciate that electron transport fundamentally drives ecosystem biogeochemistry, modulates cell-to-cell interactions, and ultimately modifies community biomass and structure.}

  abstract = {Absorption spectrophotometry, a standard tool for quantitative analysis, suffers from two major drawbacks: lack of sensitivity and vulnerability to scattering. It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

Ocean models predict declines of 1 to 7\% in the global ocean O2 inventory over the next century, with declines continuing for a thousand years or more into the future. An important consequence may be an expansion in the area and volume of so-called oxygen minimum zones, where O2 levels are too low to support many macrofauna and profound changes in biogeochemical cycling occur. Significant deoxygenation has occurred over the past 50 years in the North Pacific and tropical oceans, suggesting larger changes are looming. The potential for larger O2 declines in the future suggests the need for an improved observing system for tracking ocean O2 changes.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms tightly regulate the energy arriving to the reaction centers in order to avoid photodamage or imbalance between the photosystems. To this purpose, cyanobacteria have developed mechanisms involving relatively rapid (seconds to minutes) changes in the photosynthetic apparatus. In this review, two of these processes will be described: orange carotenoid protein(OCP)-related photoprotection and state transitions which optimize energy distribution between the two photosystems. The photoactive OCP is a light intensity sensor and an energy dissipater. Photoactivation depends on light intensity and only the red-active OCP form, by interacting with phycobilisome cores, increases thermal energy dissipation at the level of the antenna. A second protein, the ``fluorescence recovery protein'', is needed to recover full antenna capacity under low light conditions. This protein accelerates OCP conversion to the inactive orange form and plays a role in dislodging the red OCP protein from the phycobilisome. The mechanism of state transitions is still controversial. Changes in the redox state of the plastoquinone pool induce movement of phycobilisomes and/or photosystems leading to redistribution of energy absorbed by phycobilisomes between PSII and PSI and/or to changes in excitation energy spillover between photosystems. The different steps going from the induction of redox changes to movement of phycobilisomes or photosystems remain to be elucidated.},

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses (`flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 {$\mu$}s to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption cross-section decreased by about 40\%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of {$\sigma$}PS II, p, and the kinetics of Q-A reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energy-conversion.},

The presence and arrangement of these gene clusters give picocyanobacteria characteristic light absorption properties and allow the colonization of specific ecological niches. To date, a full understanding of the evolution and distribution of the PBS gene cluster in picocyanobacteria has been hampered by the scarcity of genome sequences from fresh- and brackish water-adapted strains. To remediate this, we analysed genomes assembled from metagenomic samples collected along a natural salinity gradient, and over the course of a growth season, in the Baltic Sea. We found that while PBS gene clusters in picocyanobacteria sampled in marine habitats were highly similar to known references, brackish-adapted genotypes harboured a novel type not seen in previously sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the novel gene cluster belonged to a clade of uncultivated picocyanobacteria that dominate the brackish Baltic Sea throughout the summer season, but are uncommon in other examined aquatic ecosystems. Further, our data suggest that the PE genes were lost in the ancestor of PC-containing coastal picocyanobacteria and that multiple horizontal gene transfer events have re-introduced PE genes into brackish-adapted strains, including the novel clade discovered here.}

The complete list of original Baltic strains and strains acquired from other collections, which are maintained in CCBA, will appear on the web site: http://www.ocean.univ.gda.pl/ {\textasciitilde}ccba/.

Special attention would be paid to algal species threatened by extinction, rare, en- demic, toxic, harmful or typical of our region. The growth of Baltic strains has been characterized by factorial experiment approach. The effects of salinity, light and temperature, as well as their interaction have been deter- mined. The brackishwater character showed: Chlorella vulgaris, Oocystis submarina, O. parva, Stichococcus bacillaris, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Skeletonema costatum, and Nodularia spumigena, cyanobacterium Phormidium amphibium was the marine strain and green algae from the genus Scenedesmus and Monoraphidium were freshwater strains. The growth of the above strains was strongly affected by light and temperature interaction. This effect was especially distinct in diatoms. However, the influence on the light alone was not so well-marked. For six strains: Monoraphidium convolutum, Amphora coffeaeformis, Entomoneis punctulata, Haslea spicula, Nitzschia thermaloides and the second strain of Skeletonema costatum only influence of salinity was investigated. It occurred that green alga was a typ- ically freshwater species, Skeletonema costatum showed marine character, however the re- maining strains were brackishwater.}

In contrast, chl a values remained low at the end of the experiments under treatments with full solar radiation. Phytoplankton growth rates were also inhibited by UVR, increasing up to 5 times in UVR-excluded treatments. The percentage of dead cells within Antarctic phytoplankton communities decreased in treatments with UVR blocked. The Antarctic phytoplankton populations studied appeared to be strongly controlled by UV at surface irradiances with biomasses inhibited by up to 80--90\%. This suggests that increased UVR levels over Antarctica may reduce phytoplankton growth rates and cause cell death, thus reducing the phytoplankton stock. These effects may have important consequences for the food web in Antarctic waters.},

Underwater oceanic levels of UVR and visible light can induce significant cell death in picophytoplankton communities. The decay rates of living cells induced by solar radiation was highest for Prochlorococcus sp., which showed an average decay rate of -0.24 {\textpm} 0.053 h-1 (mean {\textpm} SE) in the experiments, whereas Synechococcus sp. showed the lowest decay rate of -0.021 {\textpm} 0.008 h-1 (mean {\textpm} SE) in treatments ranging from the full incident irradiance to 23\% of the irradiance incident below the ocean surface. Decay rates decreased significantly upon removal of UVR, demonstrating a major effect of UVR on cell death, although ambient levels of visible light alone still induced cell death in Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotic populations, but not in Synechococcus sp. The high cell death of Prochlorococcus induced by total solar radiation resulted in short halflife values for this genus, ranging between 1.5 and 13.4 h across treatments. The half-life times for Synechococcus sp. and eukaryotic picoplankton cells exposed to UVR were longer, varying from 8.8 to 14.7 h and from 2.1 to 31.7 h, respectively. The UVR doses required to reduce the picophytoplankton populations by 50\% (LRD50) differed among the three groups, with considerably lower doses required for Prochlorococcus sp. Prochlorococcus sp. is highly sensitive to solar radiation, contrasting with the higher tolerance of Synechococcus sp. High, but taxonspecific, phytoplankton mortality induced by ambient UVR levels may act as a primary driver of the community structure of autotrophs and affect the dynamics of the microbial food web in clear, oligotrophic, oceanic waters.},

PCC 6803, the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana and other cyanobacteria containing phycocyanin or phycoerythrin. Our results demonstrate that specific growth rates of the cyanobacteria were similar in orange and red light, but much lower in blue light. Conversely, specific growth rates of the green alga C. sorokiniana were similar in blue and red light, but lower in orange light. Oxygen production rates of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were five-fold lower in blue than in orange and red light at low light intensities but approached the same saturation level in all three colors at high light intensities. Measurements of 77~K fluorescence emission demonstrated a lower ratio of photosystem I to photosystem II (PSI:PSII ratio) and relatively more phycobilisomes associated with PSII (state 1) in blue light than in orange and red light. These results support the hypothesis that blue light, which is not absorbed by phycobilisomes, creates an imbalance between the two photosystems of cyanobacteria with an energy excess at PSI and a deficiency at the PSII-side of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Our results help to explain why phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria use blue light less efficiently than species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae such as Prochlorococcus, green algae and~terrestrial plants.},

These strategies minimize photosystem II (PSII) photodamage by keeping the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC), and hence PSII reaction centers, more oxidized. At temperatures that approach the optimal growth temperature of each strain when cellular demand for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is greatest, the phycobilisome (PBS) antenna associates with PSII, increasing the flux of electrons into the ETC. By contrast, under low temperature, when slow growth lowers the demand for NADPH and linear ETC declines, the PBS associates with photosystem I. This favors oxidation of PSII and potential increase in cyclic electron flow. For Synechococcus sp. WH8102, growth at higher temperatures led to an increase in the abundance of PBS pigment proteins, as well as higher abundance of subunits of the PSII, photosystem I, and cytochrome b6f complexes. This would allow cells to increase photosynthetic electron flux to meet the metabolic requirement for NADPH during rapid growth. These PBS-based temperature acclimation strategies may underlie the larger geographic range of this group relative to Prochlorococcus spp., which lack a PBS.}

To explore the physiological diversity of P. marinus, we measured the physiological responses of another P. marinus clone, MED4, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate as a function of temperature was also examined for all 3 clones. P. marinus SS120 and Synechococcus WH8103 have different temperature optima for growth, but these do not explain the different latitudinal distributions in the North Atlantic. P. marinus SSI20 is adapted for growth at low light intensities relative to Synechococcus WH8103, which is consistent with the relative depth distribution of P. marinus and Synechococcus in the field. The light-dependent growth response of P. marinus MED4 is more similar to Synechococcus WH8103 than to P. marinus SS120. The unique pigment content of P. marinus (which contain divinyl chlorophylls a and b) results in maximal absorbance in the blue wavelengths. The high total chl b/chl a ratio of P. marinus SS120 enables it to absorb more light, grow faster than Synechococcus WH8103 (and P. marinus MED4) at low light intensities, and presumably to outcompete Synechococcus in the deep euphotic zone. At high growth irradiances, P. marinus SS120 contains measureable amounts of normal (monovinyl) chl b, whereas this pigment was not found in P. marinus MED4 at any growth irradiance. Photoacclimative changes in pigment ratios, and not package effect, account for most of the changes in a*ph({$\lambda$}) and F*ph({$\lambda$}) with light intensity for all 3 picoplankters. At high light intensities, zeaxanthin contributes substantially to a*ph({$\lambda$}) in the blue, but appears to transfer little or no excitation energy to the reaction centers, based on F*ph({$\lambda$}) measurements. For P. marinus, high absorption in the blue due to divinyl chl a and b relative to normal chl a and b, absorption due to zeaxanthin, and small cell size result in unusually high a*ph (blue) relative to a*ph (red).}

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({\textpm}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

  abstract = {Plants and algae have a love/hate relationship with light. As oxygenic photoautotrophic organisms, they require light for life; however, too much light can lead to increased production of damaging reactive oxygen species as byproducts of photosynthesis. In extreme cases, photooxidative damage can cause pigment bleaching and death, a phenomenon all too familiar to anyone who has tried to move a houseplant outdoors into full sunlight.The quantity of the light in natural environments can vary over several orders of magnitude and on a time scale that ranges from seconds to seasons. Because light is such an important environmental parameter, plants have evolved numerous biochemical and developmental responses to light that help to optimize photosynthesis and growth. For example, plants rely on photoreceptors such as phytochrome for shade avoidance responses. Some plants are able to adjust their capacity for harvesting sunlight through leaf and chloroplast movements. During long-term acclimation to changes in light intensity many algae and plants regulate the size of their light-harvesting pigment antennae through changes in gene expression and/or proteolysis. Large antennae are necessary for efficient light capture in limiting light, but they can be a liability when light is abundant or excessive.}

  abstract = {The marine picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus numerically dominate open ocean phytoplankton. Although evolutionarily related they are ecologically distinct, with different strategies to harvest, manage and exploit light. We grew representative strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus and tracked their susceptibility to photoinactivation of Photosystem II under a range of light levels. As expected blue light provoked more rapid photoinactivation than did an equivalent level of red light. The previous growth light level altered the susceptibility of Synechococcus, but not Prochlorococcus, to this photoinactivation. We resolved a simple linear pattern when we expressed the yield of photoinactivation on the basis of photons delivered to Photosystem II photochemistry, plotted versus excitation pressure upon Photosystem II, the balance between excitation and downstream metabolism. A high excitation pressure increases the generation of reactive oxygen species, and thus increases the yield of photoinactivation of Photosystem II. Blue photons, however, retained a higher baseline photoinactivation across a wide range of excitation pressures. Our experiments thus uncovered the relative influences of the direct photoinactivation of Photosystem II by blue photons which dominates under low to moderate blue light, and photoinactivation as a side effect of reactive oxygen species which dominates under higher excitation pressure. Synechococcus enjoyed a positive metabolic return upon the repair or the synthesis of a Photosystem II, across the range of light levels we tested. In contrast Prochlorococcus only enjoyed a positive return upon synthesis of a Photosystem II up to 400 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These differential cost-benefits probably underlie the distinct photoacclimation strategies of the species.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton primary productivity is most commonly measured by 14C assimilation although less direct methods, such as O2 exchange, have also been employed. These methods are invasive, requiring bottle incubation for up to 24 h. As an alternative, Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) has been used, on wide temporal and spatial scales within aquatic systems, to estimate photosystem II (PSII) electron flux per unit volume (JVPSII), which generally correlates well with photosynthetic O2 evolution. A major limitation of using FRRf arises from the need to employ an independent method to determine the concentration of functional photosystem II reaction centers ([RCII]); a requirement that has prevented FRR fluorometers being used, as stand-alone instruments, for the estimation of electron transport. Within this study, we have taken a new approach to the analysis of FRRf data, based on a simple hypothesis; that under a given set of environmental conditions, the ratio of rate constants for RCII fluorescence emission and photochemistry falls within a narrow range, for all groups of phytoplankton. We present a simple equation, derived from the established FRRf algorithm, for determining [RCII] from dark FRRf data alone. We also describe an entirely new algorithm for estimating JVPSII, which does not require determination of [RCII] and is valid for a heterogeneous model of connectivity among RCIIs. Empirical supporting evidence is presented. These data are derived from FRR measurements across a diverse range of microalgae, in parallel with independent measurements of [RCII]. Possible sources of error, particularly under nutrient stress conditions, are discussed.},

Although this parameter provides a reliable estimate of photosynthetic efficiency under most conditions, the extent to which this efficiency is defined by (i) competition with other energy-dissipating processes operating at photosystem II and (ii) by processes on the reducing side of photosystem II, such as carbon assimilation, requires the use of additional parameters. Of particular value are qP, which quantifies the photochemical capacity of photosystem II, and Fv-;/Fm-;, which quantifies the extent to which photochemistry at photosystem II is limited by competition with thermal decay processes. Imaging of both qP and Fv-;/Fm-; requires measurement of Fo-; (the minimum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state), which cannot be imaged with existing systems. In this paper, a method is described which estimates Fo-; through a simple equation involving the minimum fluorescence yield in the dark-adapted state (Fo), the maximum fluorescence yield in the dark-adapted state (Fm), and the maximum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state (Fm-;). This method is tested here, through comparison of measured and calculated values of Fo-;.

However, most isolates of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus naturally miss these proteins, even though they have kept the main OEC protein, PsbO. A structural homology model of the PSII of such a natural deletion mutant strain (P. marinus MED4) did not reveal any obvious compensation mechanism for this lack. To assess the physiological consequences of this unusual OEC, we compared oxygen evolution between Prochlorococcus strains missing psbU and psbV (PCC 9511 and SS120) and two marine strains possessing these genes (Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803). While the low light-adapted strain SS120 exhibited the lowest maximal O2 evolution rates (Pmax per divinyl-chlorophyll a, per cell or per photosystem II) of all four strains, the high light-adapted strain PCC 9511 displayed even higher PChlmax and PPSIImax at high irradiance than Synechococcus sp. WH7803. Furthermore, thermoluminescence glow curves did not show any alteration in the B-band shape or peak position that could be related to the lack of these extrinsic proteins. This suggests an efficient functional adaptation of the OEC in these natural deletion mutants, in which PsbO alone is seemingly sufficient to ensure proper oxygen evolution. Our study also showed that Prochlorococcus strains exhibit negative net O2 evolution rates at the low irradiances encountered in minimum oxygen zones, possibly explaining the very low O2 concentrations measured in these environments, where Prochlorococcus is the dominant oxyphototroph.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of charge recombination of the S2QA- state in photosystem II was investigated by modifying the free energy gap between the quinone acceptor QA and the primary pheophytin acceptor Ph. This was done either by changing the midpoint potential of Ph (using mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis with a modified hydrogen bond to this cofactor), or that of QA (using different inhibitors of the QB pocket). The results show that the recombination rate is dependent on the free energy gap between Ph and QA, which confirms that the indirect recombination pathway involving formation of Ph- has a significant contribution. In the mutant with the largest free energy gap, direct electron transfer from QA- to P+ predominates. The temperature dependence of the recombination rate was investigated, showing a lower activation enthalpy in this mutant compared with the WT. The data allow the determination of the rate of the direct route and of its relative weight in the various strains. The set of currently accepted values for the midpoint potentials of the QA/QA-, Ph/Ph-, and P+/P* couples is not consistent with the relatively rapid rate of the indirect recombination pathway found here, nor with the 3\% yield of delayed fluorescence as previously estimated by de Grooth and van Gorkom (1981, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 635, 445-456). It is argued that a likely explanation is that the midpoint potentials of the two latter couples are more positive than believed due to electrostatic interactions. If such is the case, the estimation of the midpoint potential of the P+/P and S2/S1 couples must also be revised upward, with values of 1260 and 1020 mV, respectively.}

This mini-review briefly summarizes our state of knowledge on energetics, kinetics and mechanism of oxidative water splitting. Essential features of the two types of reactions involved are described: (a) P680+ reduction by the redox active tyrosine Yz and (b) sequence of oxidation steps induced by Yzox in the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). The rate of the former reaction is limited by the non-adiabatic electron transfer (NET) step and the multi-phase kinetics shown to originate from a sequence of relaxation processes. In marked contrast, the rate of the stepwise oxidation by Yzox of the WOC up to the redox level S3 is not limited by NET but by trigger reactions which probably comprise proton shifts and/or conformational changes. The overall rate of the final reaction sequence leading to formation and release of O2 is assumed to be limited by the electron transfer step from the S3 state of WOC to Yzox due to involvement of an endergonic redox equilibrium. Currently discussed controversial ideas on possible pathways are briefly outlined. Several crucial points of the mechanism of oxidative water splitting, like O--O bond formation, role of local proton shift(s), details of hydrogen bonding, are still not clarified and remain a challenging topic of future research.},

The ecological success of these two genera suggests they possess sophisticated strategies to respond to variations in their environment. Indeed, it appears that it is the in situ community structure of these organisms which underlies this success, with the existence of specific ecotypes or lineages occupying different niches to populate the world's oceans. For Prochlorococcus there is now excellent physiological and genomic data for defining the basis of this niche partitioning particularly with respect to its vertical distribution down a water column. The situation for Synechococcus is more complex probably due to the larger spatial distribution of marine Synechococcus in oceanic ecosystems. This has led to extensive phylogenetic and physiological variation within the Synechococcus genus but the genomic basis for this phenotypic variation, and hence niche adaptation is less well understood. This chapter seeks to give an overview of the knowledge gained on these organisms over the last three decades focusing on aspects of ecology, physiology and molecular biology that are pertinent to this niche adaptation process.},

An upward fluctuation in irradiance can result in photosystem II photoinactivation exceeding counteracting repair rates through protein turnover, thereby leading to net photoinhibition of primary productivity, and potentially cell death. Here we show that the effective cross-section for photosystem II photoinactivation is conserved across the picocyanobacteria, but that their photosystem II repair capacity and protein-specific photosystem II light capture are negatively correlated and vary widely across the strains. The differences in repair rate correspond to the light and nutrient conditions that characterize the site of origin of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus isolates, and determine the upward fluctuation in irradiance they can tolerate, indicating that photoinhibition due to transient high-light exposure influences their distribution in the ocean.},

  abstract = {The contribution of picocyanobacteria (PCY) to summer phytoplankton blooms, accompanied by an ecological crisis is a new phenomenon in Europe. This issue requires careful investigation. The present study examined the response of Synechococcus sp. physiology to different environmental conditions. Three strains of Synechococcus sp. (red BA-120, green BA-124, and brown BA-132) were cultivated in a laboratory under previously determined environmental conditions. These conditions were as follows: temperature (T) from 10 by 5 to 25\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C, salinity from 3 by 5 to 18 PSU, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from 10 by 90 to 280\&thinsp;{\textmu}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m-2\&thinsp;s-1, which gave 64 combinations of synthetic, though realistic, environmental scenarios. Scenarios reflecting all possible combinations were applied in the laboratory experiments. Results pointed to differences in final numbers of cells among strains. However, there was also a similar tendency for BA-124 and BA-132, which demonstrated the highest concentrations of PCY cells at elevated T and PAR. This was also the case for BA-120 but only to a certain degree as the number of cells started to decrease above 190\&thinsp;{\textmu}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m-2\&thinsp;s-1\&thinsp;PAR. Pigmentation, chlorophyll a (Chl a), fluorescence, and rate of photosynthesis presented both similarities and differences among strains. In this context, more consistent features were observed between brown and red strains when compared to the green. In this paper, the ecophysiological responses of PCY are defined.},

The puzzle has been enlarged rather than solved by the progressive discovery of new phototrophic microorganisms in the oceans, including picocyanobacteria6,7, pico-eukaryotes8, and bacteriochlorophyll-based9,10,11 and rhodopsin-based phototrophic bacteria12,13. Physiological and genomic studies suggest that natural selection promotes niche differentiation among these phototrophic microorganisms, particularly with respect to their photosynthetic characteristics14,15,16. We have analysed competition for light between two closely related picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus group that we isolated from the Baltic Sea17. One of these two has a red colour because it contains the pigment phycoerythrin, whereas the other is blue-green because it contains high contents of the pigment phycocyanin. Here we report theory and competition experiments that reveal stable coexistence of the two picocyanobacteria, owing to partitioning of the light spectrum. Further competition experiments with a third marine cyanobacterium, capable of adapting its pigment composition, show that this species persists by investing in the pigment that absorbs the colour not used by its competitors. These results demonstrate the adaptive significance of divergence in pigment composition of phototrophic microorganisms, which allows an efficient utilization of light energy and favours species coexistence.},

Recent laboratory experiments showed that partitioning of white light allows stable coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria. Here, we investigate to what extent these laboratory findings can be extrapolated to natural waters. We predict from a parameterized competition model that the underwater light colour of lakes and seas provides ample opportunities for coexistence of red and green phytoplankton species. To test this prediction, we sampled picocyanobacteria of 70 aquatic ecosystems, ranging from clear blue oceans to turbid brown peat lakes. As predicted, red picocyanobacteria dominated in clear waters, whereas green picocyanobacteria dominated in turbid waters. We found widespread coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria in waters of intermediate turbidity. These field data support the hypothesis that niche differentiation along the light spectrum promotes phytoplankton biodiversity, thus providing a colourful solution to the paradox of the plankton.},

We focused our efforts on single turnover methods, which are most commonly used in phytoplankton research, while recognizing that other approaches, including Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorescence techniques, are also employed with macro-algae, corals and terrestrial plants. Over the past two years, our group has worked to build consensus around best practice for the collection, analysis and archiving of ST-ChlF data from a variety of aquatic environments.

  abstract = {Marine picocyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the modern ocean, where they exert a profound influence on elemental cycling and energy flow. The use of transmembrane chlorophyll complexes instead of phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae is considered a defining attribute of Prochlorococcus. Its ecology and evolution are understood in terms of light, temperature, and nutrients. Here, we report single-cell genomic information on previously uncharacterized phylogenetic lineages of this genus from nutrient-rich anoxic waters of the eastern tropical North and South Pacific Ocean. The most basal lineages exhibit optical and genotypic properties of phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria, indicating that the characteristic light-harvesting antenna of the group is not an ancestral attribute. Additionally, we found that all the indigenous lineages analyzed encode genes for pigment biosynthesis under oxygen-limited conditions, a trait shared with other freshwater and coastal marine cyanobacteria. Our findings thus suggest that Prochlorococcus diverged from other cyanobacteria under low-oxygen conditions before transitioning from phycobilisomes to transmembrane chlorophyll complexes and may have contributed to the oxidation of the ancient ocean.}

  abstract = {Vast expanses of oxygen-deficient and nitrite-rich water define the major oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the global ocean. They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ``end points'' represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories, leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to continue well into the future.}

  abstract = {Light induced damage of the photosynthetic apparatus is an important and highly complex phenomenon, which affects primarily the Photosystem II complex. Here the author summarizes the current state of understanding of the molecular mechanisms, which are involved in the light induced inactivation of Photosystem II electron transport together with the relevant mechanisms of photoprotection. Short wavelength ultraviolet radiation impairs primarily the Mn4Ca catalytic site of the water oxidizing complex with additional effects on the quinone electron acceptors and tyrosine donors of PSII. The main mechanism of photodamage by visible light appears to be mediated by acceptor side modifications, which develop under conditions of excess excitation in which the capacity of light-independent photosynthetic processes limits the utilization of electrons produced in the initial photoreactions. This situation of excess excitation facilitates the reduction of intersystem electron carriers and Photosystem II acceptors, and thereby induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, especially singlet oxygen whose production is sensitized by triplet chlorophyll formation in the reaction center of Photosystem II. The highly reactive singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2 and O2-, which can also be formed in Photosystem II initiate damage of electron transport components and protein structure. In parallel with the excess excitation dependent mechanism of photodamage inactivation of the Mn4Ca cluster by visible light may also occur, which impairs electron transfer through the Photosystem II complex and initiates further functional and structural damage of the reaction center via formation of highly oxidizing radicals, such as P680+ and Tyr-Z+. However, the available data do not support the hypothesis that the Mn-dependent mechanism would be the exclusive or dominating pathway of photodamage in the visible spectral range.

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms have developed multiple protective mechanisms to survive under high-light conditions. In plants, one of these mechanisms is the thermal dissipation of excitation energy in the membrane-bound chlorophyll antenna of photosystem II. The question of whether or not cyanobacteria, the progenitor of the chloroplast, have an equivalent photoprotective mechanism has long been unanswered. Recently, however, evidence was presented for the possible existence of a mechanism dissipating excess absorbed energy in the phycobilisome, the extramembrane antenna of cyanobacteria. Here, we demonstrate that this photoprotective mechanism, characterized by blue light--induced fluorescence quenching, is indeed phycobilisome-related and that a soluble carotenoid binding protein, ORANGE CAROTENOID PROTEIN (OCP), encoded by the slr1963 gene in Synechocystis PCC 6803, plays an essential role in this process. Blue light is unable to quench fluorescence in the absence of phycobilisomes or OCP. The fluorescence quenching is not {$\Delta$}pH-dependent, and it can be induced in the absence of the reaction center II or the chlorophyll antenna, CP43 and CP47. Our data suggest that OCP, which strongly interacts with the thylakoids, acts as both the photoreceptor and the mediator of the reduction of the amount of energy transferred from the phycobilisomes to the photosystems. These are novel roles for a soluble carotenoid protein.}

  abstract = {Environmental toxicology focuses on identifying and predicting impact of potentially toxic anthropogenic chemicals on biosphere at various levels of biological organization. Presently there is a significant drive to gain deeper understanding of cellular and sub-cellular mechanisms of ecotoxicity. Most notable is increased focus on elucidation of cellular-response networks, interactomes, and greater implementation of cell-based biotests using high-throughput procedures, while at the same time decreasing the reliance on standard animal models used in ecotoxicity testing. This is aimed at discovery and interpretation of molecular pathways of ecotoxicity at large scale. In this regard, the applications of cytometry are perhaps one of the most fundamental prospective analytical tools for the next generation and high-throughput ecotoxicology research. The diversity of this modern technology spans flow, laser-scanning, imaging, and more recently, Raman as well as mass cytometry. The cornerstone advantages of cytometry include the possibility of multi-parameter measurements, gating and rapid analysis. Cytometry overcomes, thus, limitations of traditional bulk techniques such as spectrophotometry or gel-based techniques that average the results from pooled cell populations or small model organisms. Novel technologies such as cell imaging in flow, laser scanning cytometry, as well as mass cytometry provide innovative and tremendously powerful capabilities to analyze cells, tissues as well as to perform in situ analysis of small model organisms. In this review, we outline cytometry as a tremendously diverse field that is still vastly underutilized and often largely unknown in environmental sciences. The main motivation of this work is to highlight the potential and wide-reaching applications of cytometry in ecotoxicology, guide environmental scientists in the technological aspects as well as popularize its broader adoption in environmental risk assessment.},

  abstract = {It is commonly known that phytoplankton have a pivotal role in marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems as carbon fixers and oxygen producers, but their response to deoxygenation has scarcely been studied. Nonetheless, in the major oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), all surface phytoplankton groups, regardless of size, disappear and are replaced by unique cyanobacteria lineages below the oxycline. To develop reasonable hypotheses to explain this pattern, we conduct a review of available information on OMZ phytoplankton, and we re-analyze previously published data (flow cytometric and hydrographic) on vertical structure of phytoplankton communities in relation to light and O2 levels. We also review the physical constraints on O2 acquisition as well as O2-dependent metabolisms in phototrophs. These considerations, along with estimates of the photosynthetic capacity of phytoplankton along OMZ depth profiles using published data, suggest that top-down grazing, respiratory demand, and irradiance are insufficient to fully explain the vertical structure observed in the upper, more sunlit portions of OMZs. Photorespiration and water--water cycles are O2-dependent pathways with low O2 affinities. Although their metabolic roles are still poorly understood, a hypothetical dependence on such pathways by the phytoplankton adapted to the oxic ocean might explain vertical patterns in OMZs and results of laboratory experiments. This can be represented in a simple model in which the requirement for photorespiration in surface phytoplankton and O2-inhibition of OMZ lineages reproduces the observed vertical fluorescence profiles and the replacement of phytoplankton adapted to O2 by lineages restricted to the most O2-deficient waters. A high O2 requirement by modern phytoplankton would suggest a positive feedback that intensifies trends in OMZ extent and ocean oxygenation or deoxygenation, both in Earth's past and in response to current climate change.},

The fitting coefficient {$\rho$} measures excitation transfer from closed PSII to remaining open PSII upon illumination, which could theoretically generate a progressive increase in {$\sigma$}PSII for the remaining open PSII. To investigate how {$\rho$} responds to illumination we grew marine phytoplankters with diverse antenna structures (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira pseudonana) under limiting or saturating growth light. Initial {$\rho$} varied with growth light in Synechococcus and Thalassiosira. With increasing actinic illumination PSII closed progressively and {$\rho$} decreased for all four taxa, in a pattern explicable as an exponential decay of {$\rho$} with increasing distance between remaining open PSII reaction centers. This light-dependent down-regulation of {$\rho$} allows the four phytoplankters to limit the effect of increasing light upon {$\sigma$}PSII. The four structurally distinct taxa showed, however, distinct rates of response of {$\rho$} to PSII closure, likely reflecting differences in the spacing or orientation among their PSII centers. Following saturating illumination recovery of {$\rho$} in darkness coincided directly with PSII re-opening in Prochlorococcus. Even after PSII had re-opened in Synechococcus a transition to State II slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Ostreococcus sustained NPQ slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Thalassiosira dark recovery of {$\rho$} was slowed, possibly by a light-induced change in PSII spacing. These patterns of {$\rho$} versus PSII closure are thus a convenient probe of comparative PSII spacings.},

Phytoplankters regulate {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$} to mitigate over- or under-excitation of Photosystem II. We used diverse phytoplankton taxa to compare short term changes in {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$} with the induction of the yield of non-photochemical quenching (YNPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence, a measure of regulated excitation dissipation. In two picocyanobacteria {$\sigma$}PSII' showed no decline upon induction of moderate YNPQ, above light levels sufficient for saturation of electron transport. In the eukaryotic chl a/b Ostreococcus and the chl a/c diatom Thalassiosira, induction of non-photochemical quenching was stronger after growth under saturating light, an acclimation attributable to increased xanthophyll cycle pigment content. Across short and longer-term light histories to induce or relax regulatory processes Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira showed proportional variations between the level of YNPQ and the down regulation of {$\sigma$}PSII'. The proportional down regulation of {$\sigma$}PSII' was, however, significantly smaller than the amplitude of YNPQ induction. For the eukaryotes we can predict changes in {$\sigma$}PSII', useful for modelling electron transport, productivity and acclimation, from measures of YNPQ, which are accessible from fluorescence yield measures that do not include {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$}. This useful relation, however, does not extend to the tested prokaryotes, possibly as a result of differential violations of the rate constant assumptions that underlie the calculated YNPQ parameter.},
