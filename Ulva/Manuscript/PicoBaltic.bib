  abstract = {Eucheumatoid seaweed farming in the Philippines, a major seaweed producing country, faces multiple challenges such as ``ice-ice'' diseases, environmental degradation, and increasing conflicts over farming areas due to an expanding population. Additionally, farmers lose income during off season or when market price for seaweeds is low. Nevertheless, farmers have been innovative in overcoming these challenges, as seen in their use of inorganic commercial fertilizers (ICF) in seaweed farming. We investigated local perceptions among seaweed farmers in Tawi-Tawi, dubbed as the seaweed capital of the country, regarding the effects of ICF on seaweed farming. Results showed that about 90\,\% of the farmers used ICF. ``Fast growth'', ``recovery from early onset of diseases'', and ``year-round farming'', i.e. growth during off-season and in previously less farmable areas, were the major perceived positive impacts. However, farmers also perceived significant negative impacts, including ``increased workload'', ``increased expenses'', ``health concerns'', and ``impacts on environment and seaweeds'', i.e., perennial bloom of macroalgae Ulva spp. and epiphytes. Farmers also perceived that seaweeds had become ``dependent'' on ICF, resulting in ``stunted growth'' without it. None of the socioeconomic factors considered significantly influenced the overall perceptions on ICF use. Nonetheless, farmers expressed willingness to give up ICF use if quality seedlings that are fast-growing and disease-resistant were available. Our study highlights the alarming issues associated with ICF use in seaweed farming, and underscores the importance of leveraging local ecological knowledge that is backed by science to develop innovative strategies that ensure the economic viability and environmental sustainability of seaweed farming.},

This represents an environmental problem of aquatic environment and water quality. On the other hand, this massive growth of Ulva species can be used as economic source of different natural products. The biochemical analysis of Ulva species indicated that Ulva pertusa have higher contents of proteins, lipids, minerals, soluble and insoluble carbohydrates than those of Ulva lactuca. The qualitative studies of natural products indicated that Ulva pertusa contains alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, phenols and quinones while Ulva lactuca contains alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, cumarins and quinones. Further study to determine the quantitative contents of natural products and its bioactivity is needed.}

  abstract = {Intense blooms of the toxic benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata have been a recurrent phenomenon along several Mediterranean coasts during summer in the last few years. These blooms are often associated with noxious effects on humans and deaths of benthic invertebrates. Previous studies carried out on the Conero Riviera (northern Adriatic Sea) highlighted that Ostreopsis abundances recorded on rocks were significantly higher than on the surface of seaweeds, suggesting that some allelopathic interactions might occur between Ostreopsis and macroalgal substrates. In this study we investigated under experimental conditions the interactions between O. cf. ovata and three of the most common macroalgae in this area: Dictyota dichotoma (brown alga), Rhodymenia pseudopalmata (red alga) and Ulva rigida (green alga). Three different experiments were set up: O. cf. ovata was grown (i) together with fresh macroalgal tissues, (ii) in media in which macroalgae were previously cultured, and (iii) in media with the addition of dry macroalgal powder at different concentrations. The results indicated that all the investigated seaweeds exerted negative effects toward the benthic dinoflagellate O. cf. ovata. D. dichotoma inhibited the growth of O. cf. ovata in all tested experimental conditions; U. rigida had inhibitory effect both in form of fresh thalli and dry powder but not as growth medium filtrate, suggesting that either Ulva does not release any allelopathic compound in the medium in absence of O. cf. ovata or the alleged released allelochemicals are rapidly degradable. Neither the fresh thalli of R. pseudopalmata or the filtrate of its culture medium showed any inhibitory effects, while a negative effect was only observed at high concentrations of dry thallus powder. With the exception of D. dichotoma co-culture experiment, a complete algicidal effect was never observed partly because O. cf. ovata produced a large amount of resting stages, which permitted its survival.},

Estuarine populations are highly diverse and consist of many co-occurring strains, but their physiology remains largely understudied. In this study, we characterized 17 novel estuarine picocyanobacterial strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and pigment genes (cpcB and cpeBA) uncovered multiple estuarine and freshwater-related clusters and pigment types. Assays with five representative strains (three phycocyanin rich and two phycoerythrin rich) under temperature (10--30{$^\circ$}C), light (10--190 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1), and salinity (2--14 PSU) gradients revealed distinct growth optima and tolerance, indicating that genetic variability was accompanied by physiological diversity. Adaptability to environmental conditions was associated with differential pigment content and photosynthetic performance. Amplicon sequence variants at a coastal and an offshore station linked population dynamics with phylogenetic clusters, supporting that strains isolated in this study represent key ecotypes within the Baltic Sea picocyanobacterial community. The functional diversity found within strains with the same pigment type suggests that understanding estuarine picocyanobacterial ecology requires analysis beyond the phycocyanin and phycoerythrin divide. This new knowledge of the environmental preferences in estuarine picocyanobacteria is important for understanding and evaluating productivity in current and future ecosystems.},

The fatty acid composition of four species of Ulvaceae (U. fasciata, U. pertusa, U. arasakii and U. conglobota) was analyzed by capillary gas chromatography to investigate the relationship with the algicidal activity. The results indicate that highly algicidal species, U. fasciata and U. pertusa, showed higher contents of C16:4 n-3, C18:3 n-3, and C18:4 n-3. Concentrations of these PUFAs released from the seaweed in the culture medium were also analyzed. These PUFAs were found to be significantly active against Chattonella antiqua, C. marina, Fibrocapsa japonica, Heterosigma akashiwo, Karenia mikimotoi, moderately effective against Heterocapsa circularisquama, Prorocentrum minimum, P. sigmoides, Scrippsiella trochoidea, whereas low effective against Alexandrium catenella and Cochlodinium polykrikoides. It is suggested that the PUFAs are useful mitigation agents to remove several harmful effects without causing detrimental effects on surrounding marine living organisms.},

Besides containing nitrogenase2, heterocysts are distinguished biochemically from vegetative cells by their inability to evolve O2 or to perform photosystem II activities1,3,4and by a deficiency in the CO2 fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase5. These cells also lack phycobiliproteins and phycobilisomes, that are part of the major light-collecting system for the light reactions of photosynthesis1,6. The phycobilipigments, light-collecting chlorophyll a and the photochemical reaction centres constitute a photosynthetic unit (PSU)---the minimum number of pigments necessary to drive photochemistry, oxygen evolution and photosynthetic electron transport. Therefore, the PSU represents an energy generating unit. In cyanobacteria, photosynthesis, and hence the PSU, contributes both ATP and probably a strong reductant to drive nitrogen fixation8. Because of the distinct photosynthetic properties of these cells, especially in pigmentation, we have compared the functional organisation of the pigments and photochemical activity of the thylakoid membranes from vegetative and heterocyst cells of Nostoc muscorum and Anabaena cylindrica. We demonstrate that the PSU is modified during the differentiation of heterocysts to support the specialised energetic requirements of these nitrogen fixing cells.},

If there is interaction between two factors model of observations include interaction term and is called 'non-additive model' which makes interaction and non-additivity equivalent in terms of meaning. When there are several observations taken at each level combination of two variables, testing non-additivity can easily be done by usual two-way ANOVA method which cannot be used when there is only one observation per cell. For the cases with only one observation per cell, some methods have been developed starting with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test in which interaction is supposed to be the product of two factor's effects. There are other methods which are used for different structures of interaction when there is only one observation. In this paper, we review some of these tests. After presenting general methodology for the two-factor linear model with interaction effect and the general two-way ANOVA method when there are n {$>$} 1 observations per cell, we present some methods for testing non-additivity when there is only one observation per cell.

The biomass and distribution of Gracilaria and Ulva are described in relation to the seasonal water chemistry of the bay.

  abstract = {High light stress results in a reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of plants. This photoinhibition is targeted to photosystem II and seems to be an inevitable consequence of the complicated redox chemistry involved in the light-driven water-plastoquinone oxidoreduction reaction. Photoinactivation leads to irreversible damage of the reaction centre of photosystem II, in particular the D1 protein. In this paper, we present evidence which indicates that the inhibition of electron transport can be initiated at both the acceptor and donor sides of photosystem II. In the former case, there is a sequential array of events leading to overreduction of the primary quinone acceptor QA. This, in turn, leads to the formation of a P680 chlorophyll triplet. The donor-side inhibition is thought to involve the accumulation of the highly oxidizing species P+680 and Tyr+z. These species will lead to oxidative damage of the D1 protein, triggering it for degradation. During acceptor-side inhibition, the protein is damaged by singlet oxygen formed via a reaction between P680 triplet and oxygen. Damaged D1 protein is degraded by a serine protease located in the photosystem II complex. Preliminary inhibition and binding studies using the classical serine protease inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate suggest that the active serine is located on a 43 kDa polypeptide. Several D1 protein digestion fragments have been identified and a cleavage site between the stromally exposed loop connecting transmembrane helices IV and V is suggested.},

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of meso-scale surface sediment morphology on the dynamics of the macroalgae Ulvales (Chlorophyta) and associated macroepifauna in the Ria Formosa tidal lagoon (southern coast of Portugal). Four sites in the Ria Formosa were sampled monthly. Two were located on convex sections (mounds) of the mudflat and the other two on concave sections (depressions). Macroalgae and related macroepifauna were sampled at each station. Biomass was quantified by determination of the ash-free dry weight (AFDW). Data were analysed using the software package `PRIMER' (Plymouth Routines In Multivariate Ecological Research). Results show a clear distinction between convex and concave areas. In convex sections, Enteromorpha dominated, to the point of being the only algal species present during part of the year. Conversely, biomass and dynamics of Enteromorpha and Ulva were almost the same in concave sections. The associated macroepifauna was also different in protruding or depressed sections of the mudflat. In the convex areas, the macroepifauna population showed less diversity and was dominated by the snail Hydrobia ulvae. In concave areas, the species diversity was larger, but dominated in terms of biomass by the amphipod Melita palmata and the gastropod Nassarius pfeifferi. Results of the study indicate that the benthic communities associated with concave or convex features were different. No relevant differences in texture and sediment physico-chemical characteristics were found between convex and concave sections. The inference is that the morphological nature of the bottom in tidal mudflats can act as a structuring agent of benthic communities.},

The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the phycobiliprotein subfamilies, previously classified by their biochemical and spectroscopic properties, also formed coherent evolutionary groups. The {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} subunits formed two distinct evolutionary lines that originate from a common ancestor. The pattern of divergence among the {$\alpha$} subfamilies was identical to that of the {$\beta$} subfamilies, strongly suggesting that the {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} subunits of each phycobiliprotein type have coevolved.

  abstract = {Measurements of diurnal changes in ocean color in turbid coastal regions in the Gulf of Mexico were characterized using above water spectral radiometry from a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (aerosol robotic network-WaveCIS CSI-06) site that can provide 8 to 10 observations per day. Satellite capability to detect diurnal changes in ocean color was characterized using hourly overlapping afternoon orbits of the visual infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ocean color sensor and validated with in situ observations. The monthly cycle of diurnal changes was investigated for different water masses using VIIRS overlaps. Results showed the capability of satellite observations to monitor hourly color changes in coastal regions that can be impacted by vertical movement of optical layers, in response to tides, resuspension, and river plume dispersion. The spatial variability of VIIRS diurnal changes showed the occurrence and displacement of phytoplankton blooming and decaying processes. The diurnal change in ocean color was above 20\%, which represents a 30\% change in chlorophyll-a. Seasonal changes in diurnal ocean color for different water masses suggest differences in summer and winter responses to surface processes. The diurnal changes observed using satellite ocean color can be used to define the following: surface processes associated with biological activity, vertical changes in optical depth, and advection of water masses.}

The liquid brine fraction of the ice matrix is home to a diverse array of organisms, ranging from tiny archaea to larger fish and invertebrates. These organisms can tolerate high brine salinity and low temperature but do best when conditions are milder. Thriving ice algal communities, generally dominated by diatoms, live at the ice/water interface and in recently flooded surface and interior layers, especially during spring, when temperatures begin to rise. Although protists dominate the sea ice biomass, heterotrophic bacteria are also abundant. The sea ice ecosystem provides food for a host of animals, with crustaceans being the most conspicuous. Uneaten organic matter from the ice sinks through the water column and feeds benthic ecosystems. As sea ice extent declines, ice algae likely contribute a shrinking fraction of the total amount of organic matter produced in polar waters.},

  abstract = {Carbon fixation has a central role in determining cellular redox poise, increasingly understood to be a key parameter in cyanobacterial physiology. In the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus---the most abundant phototroph in the oligotrophic oceans---the carbon-concentrating mechanism is reduced to the bare essentials. Given the ability of Prochlorococcus populations to grow under a wide range of oxygen concentrations in the ocean, we wondered how carbon and oxygen physiology intersect in this minimal phototroph. Thus, we examined how CO2:O2 gas balance influenced growth and chlorophyll fluorescence in Prochlorococcus strain MED4. Under O2 limitation, per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence fell at all CO2 levels, but still permitted substantial growth at moderate and high CO2. Under CO2 limitation, we observed little growth at any O2 level, although per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence fell less sharply when O2 was available. We explored this pattern further by monitoring genome-wide transcription in cells shocked with acute limitation of CO2, O2 or both. O2 limitation produced much smaller transcriptional changes than the broad suppression seen under CO2 limitation and CO2/O2 co-limitation. Strikingly, both CO2 limitation conditions initially evoked a transcriptional response that resembled the pattern previously seen in high-light stress, but at later timepoints we observed O2-dependent recovery of photosynthesis-related transcripts. These results suggest that oxygen has a protective role in Prochlorococcus when carbon fixation is not a sufficient sink for light energy.}

Ulva contains 31.5\% carbohydrate with a total ulvan content of 43.66\% of total carbohydrate (13.75~g/100~g DW) and sulfate content of 20.45\% of ulvan. FTIR spectrum presented signals of the sulfate ester (C--O--S) and sulfate groups (S=O), typical for ulvan. GC--MS revealed that ulvan was mainly composed of rhamnose and fucose. 1H-NMR spectra of ulvan showed identical behavior of monosaccharides nature with peaks characteristic of sulfated polysaccharides at 3.2--5.3~ppm region. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) demonstrated amorphous architecture, and the sulfated nature of polysaccharides was emphasized by EDX analysis. The extracted ulvan showed significant antimicrobial activity against human and fish pathogens as well as antifouling bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 8~{\textmu}g/mL. The extracted ulvan exhibited potent antioxidant activity with a scavenging effect of 84.93\% for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazy free radical (DPPH). Moreover, it showed anti-arthritic properties for the first time with a maximum inhibition of 86.04\% with IC50 of 43.21\%, indicating their potential value for the health and food industry.},

The results of these studies are increasing our understanding of the biosynthetic enzyme reaction mechanisms, the physical properties of the enzymes, modes of metabolic regulation, the evolution of the pathway, and the phylogenetic relationships among cyanobacteria, other bacteria, algae, and plants. In this article, emphasis is placed on the individual enzymatic steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, the natures of substrates, reaction intermediates, and products, the physical, kinetic, and regulatory properties of the enzymes, and the identification of genes that encode the enzymes. Because of the limited amount of available information that has been directly derived from cyanobacteria, results obtained from other organisms is discussed wherever it is likely to be applicable to cyanobacteria.},

An intense macroalgal photosynthetic activity can increase the surrounding pH and it could prevent the acidification that often follows an eutrophication process. We tested this hypothesis with field sampling and experiments in a macrotidal (up to 9~m in amplitude) coastal system within a semi-desert region with contrasting eutrophic conditions and Ulva lactuca blooms in the northern Argentinean Patagonia (San Antonio Bay). Our results indicate that daily pH variability during low tide could be controlled by the photosynthetic activity of Ulva lactuca under eutrophic conditions. At seasonal scale, the pH variations were related to environmental features, particularly seawater temperature. Both environmental (i.e. high solar radiation, negligible freshwater inputs and large tidal action) and anthropogenic nutrient inputs into the studied area promote the Ulva lactuca blooms, which in turn increases the surrounding pH in well oxygenated seawater through the intense photosynthetic activity. Our study shows that eutrophication instead of being a driver of acidification, could contribute to its prevention in well oxygenated marine coastal systems located within semi-desert regions.},

Most strikingly, red-illuminated cultures contain no measurable C-phycoerythrin and have a mean filament length about 10 times shorter than fluorescent-illuminated cultures. C-phycoerythrin behaves as a photoinducible constituent of this alga. Spectrophotometric and immunochemical procedures were devised so that C-phycoerythrin metabolism could be studied quantitatively with [14C]-phenylalanine pulse-chased cultures. Transfer of red-illuminated cultures to fluorescent light initiates C-phycoerythrin production by essentially de novo synthesis. C-phycoerythrin is not degraded to any significant extent in cultures continuously illuminated with fluorescent light. Transfer of fluorescent-illuminated cultures to red light causes an abrupt cessation of C-phycoerythrin synthesis. The C-phycoerythrin content of cultures adapting to red light decreases and subsequently becomes constant. Loss of C-phycoerythrin is not brought about by metabolic degradation, but rather by a decrease in mean filament length which is effected by transcellular breakage. In this experimental system, light influences intracellular C-phycoerythrin levels by regulating the rate of synthesis of the chromoprotein.},

The pigment binding proteins associated with PSII assemble in the grana membrane into PSII supercomplexes and surrounding light harvesting complex II trimers. To understand the high efficiency of light harvesting in PSII requires quantitative insight into energy transfer and charge separation in PSII supercomplexes. We have constructed the first structure-based model of energy transfer in PSII supercomplexes. This model shows that the kinetics of light harvesting cannot be simplified to a single rate limiting step. Instead, substantial contributions arise from both excitation diffusion through the antenna pigments and transfer from the antenna to the reaction center (RC), where charge separation occurs. Because of the lack of a rate-limiting step, fitting kinetic models to fluorescence lifetime data cannot be used to derive mechanistic insight on light harvesting in PSII. This model will clarify the interpretation of chlorophyll fluorescence data from PSII supercomplexes, grana membranes, and leaves.}

They are key components of the structure and dynamics of the oceans and thus sustain the benefits that humans obtain from these aquatic environments. However, some microalgal blooms can cause harm to humans and other organisms. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have direct impacts on human health and negative influences on human wellbeing, mainly through their consequences to coastal ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism and recreation) and other marine organisms and environments. HABs are natural phenomena, but these events can be favoured by anthropogenic pressures in coastal areas. Global warming and associated changes in the oceans could affect HAB occurrences and toxicity as well, although forecasting the possible trends is still speculative and requires intensive multidisciplinary research. At the beginning of the 21st century, with expanding human populations, particularly in coastal and developing countries, mitigating HABs impacts on human health and wellbeing is becoming a more pressing public health need. The available tools to address this global challenge include maintaining intensive, multidisciplinary and collaborative scientific research, and strengthening the coordination with stakeholders, policymakers and the general public. Here we provide an overview of different aspects of the HABs phenomena, an important element of the intrinsic links between oceans and human health and wellbeing.},

  abstract = {This document represents the collective efforts of SCOR Working Group 156, `Active Chlorophyll Fluorescence for Autonomous Measurements of Global Marine Primary Productivity'. The group was established in 2019, bringing together researchers and instrument manufacturers from 10 countries and 6 continents to develop standards of best practice in the application of single turnover active chlorophyll fluorescence (ST-ChlF) for phytoplankton photo-physiology and productivity measurements. We focused our efforts on single turnover ChlF methods, which are most prevalent in phytoplankton research, while recognizing that other approaches, including Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorescence, are also commonly employed with macro-algae, corals and terrestrial plants. Some of the material in this document will apply to those related measurement techniques. During the period between 2019-2022, our group worked to build consensus around best practice for the collection, analysis, interpretation and archiving of ST-ChlF data from a variety of aquatic environments. This work was aimed at facilitating wide-spread use of ST-ChlF methods by the international research community, focussing on two key objectives outlined in the Working Group's terms of reference: 1. To develop, implement and document internationally-agreed best practice for the acquisition and analysis of ST-ChlF data to retrieve photosynthetic parameters and primary productivity estimates. 2. To develop, implement and document standardised ST-ChlF data output formats and archiving approaches. As a first step towards these objectives, we published a review article (Schuback et al. 2021), outlining applications, opportunities and current limitations of ST-ChlF measurements. This highlevel review was aimed at readers wishing to apply ST-ChlF methods and interpret the resulting data in the most robust manner possible. Journal length restrictions precluded in-depth treatment of many important topics, including instrument calibration, data fitting and spectral correction. In this User Guide, we expand on the material presented by Schuback et al. (2021), providing handson guidance for both experts and new users alike. With this document, we aim to provide both a strong theoretical background for ST-ChlF methods, and a practical handbook to inform the application of these methods across a wide range of aquatic environments. We assume that readers of have a basic understanding of aquatic photosynthesis, as outlined, for example, by Falkowski and Raven (2013). This document represents the first complete version of the SCOR ST-ChlF user guide. It is being released to the international research community for a period of open consultation. We encourage comments and suggestions, which can be addressed to the working group co-chairs, Philippe Tortell and David Suggett. We expect the contents of this User Guide to evolve significantly over time, through our own efforts and with input from other experts and end-users. Revised versions of the User Guide will be posted on the Ocean Best Practices site (https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/), and interested readers are encouraged to check periodically for updates. In follow up work, we aim to further develop existing open-source software (e.g. Ryan-Keogh and Robinson, 2021) to facilitate ST-ChlF data analysis from a range of different instruments and formats. This document is intended to serve the needs of a wide range of users, from novices (first year graduate students, for example) to expert researchers with decades of experience using ST-ChlF methods. We anticipate that some readers will require only high-level information on key operational parameters needed for successful ST-ChlF measurements, while others will be interested in further exploring the underlying ideas and concepts. For this reason, the document includes appendices that provide greater detail on some topics presented in the main document. In subsequent versions of this User Guide, we aim to include linked Jupyter notebooks, with handson tutorials and data processing tools. These software tools will help facilitate the inter-comparison of measurements collected by different users and instruments, supporting the development of globally-coherent ST-ChlF data compilations.},

In this study spatial and temporal patterns of biomass distribution were assessed for two Ulva morphologies in two Irish estuaries heavily affected by green tides (wet biomass {$>$}1\,kg m-2 during the peak bloom). Moreover, using genetic markers, the species composition of these green tides was assessed. Results revealed that these blooms were multi-specific, with Ulva prolifera, U. compressa and U.rigida the most frequent species. The species U. prolifera and U. compressa usually showed a tubular morphology, while U. rigida was mainly laminar. A seasonal succession common to both estuaries was also identified, with the bloom dominated by tubular species during spring and early summer, and co-dominated by tubular and laminar morphologies during late summer and autumn. Moreover, tubular and laminar morphologies exhibited different distribution patterns, with tubular morphologies varying at bigger spatial scales and higher biomass than the laminar. As tubular and laminar morphologies exhibited different distribution patterns, varying tubular morphologies along bigger spatial scales with higher biomass levels than the laminar. Considering that tubular morphologies were usually anchored to the sediment, while laminar Ulva were usually observed free-floating, these differences could explain a differential influence by water motion. An important annual and decadal variability in biomass levels of Ulva was observed, in the case of the Tolka estuary a noticeable increase over the last two decades. These findings should be considered for the development of management and monitoring strategies since the different habitat of laminar and tubular morphologies (anchored vs. free-floating) may play an important role in the balance of nutrients and biomass in the estuary, or determine the response to pollutant exposure. Furthermore, the presence of different species with different ecological requirements could favour the duration and extension of the bloom though temporal and spatial successions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Coastal ecosystems are subject to human impacts both through adjacent lands and by run-off from the broader catchment area. Nutrient inputs, like phosphorus, were often lowered decades ago, but many aquatic ecosystems have not recovered accordingly. Therefore, restoration and future protection measures need to be founded upon insights on the nutrient demands of phytoplankton in order to limit their growth and negative impacts upon coastal water bodies. This study investigated phosphatase activity, phosphate uptake, and growth of phytoplankton in a model lagoon system at the southern Baltic Sea coast. This lagoon system is perennially dominated by {$<$}italic{$>$}Cyanobium{$<$}/italic{$>$}, a clade of picocyanobacteria which lack nitrogen fixation but which are common in brackish waters. Dissolved phosphate and total nutrient ratios from long-term monitoring point to an overall P-limitation of the system. Apparent phosphatase activities confirmed P-starvation. However, experimental phosphate-fertilizations repeated over an annual cycle increased chlorophyll concentration only when either dissolved nitrogen, or N-fixing cyanobacteria were present. In contrast to chlorophyll, particulate matter increased within a week most of the time at the observed stations, even in unfertilized samples. The difference between chlorophyll and particulate responses could be explained by chlorosis after phosphorus fertilization, as nitrogen was co-limiting. Similar findings have been described for other water bodies. This study indicates that nitrogen is co-limiting in the lagoon system, and that phosphorus input has not yet declined sufficiently.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Transmittance spectra corrected for various instrumental error sources were used in an automated single spectrum fit line parameter retrieval based on the Voigt profile. Average gas temperatures were fitted from retrieved water line strengths. From the retrieved Lorentzian line widths of each individual transition the air and self-broadening parameters and temperature exponents, {$\gamma$}air, {$\gamma$}self, nair, nself, or a subset thereof were fitted in an automated procedure. Various methods for validation of data product accuracy and data reduction model as well as comprehensive error analysis were applied.

  abstract = {Electron transfer reactions among colored cytochromes in intact bacterial cells were monitored using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted the acquisition of accurate absorbance data in suspensions of cells that scatter light. The aerobic iron respiratory chain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was dominated by the redox status of an abundant cellular cytochrome that had an absorbance peak at 579\,nm in the reduced state. Intracellular cytochrome 579 was reduced within the time that it took to mix a suspension of the bacteria with soluble ferrous iron at pH 1.7. Steady state turnover experiments were conducted where the initial concentrations of ferrous iron were less than or equal to that of the oxygen concentration. Under these conditions, the initial absorbance spectrum of the bacterium observed under air-oxidized conditions was always regenerated from that of the bacterium observed in the presence of Fe(II). The kinetics of aerobic respiration on soluble iron by intact L. ferrooxidans conformed to the Michaelis--Menten formalism, where the reduced intracellular cytochrome 579 represented the Michaelis complex whose subsequent oxidation appeared to be the rate-limiting step in the overall aerobic respiratory process. The velocity of formation of ferric iron at any time point was directly proportional to the concentration of the reduced cytochrome 579. Further, the integral over time of the concentration of the reduced cytochrome was directly proportional to the total concentration of ferrous iron in each reaction mixture. These kinetic data obtained using whole cells were consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cytochrome 579 is an obligatory steady state intermediate in the iron respiratory chain of this bacterium. The capability of conducting visible spectroscopy in suspensions of intact cells comprises a powerful post-reductionist means to study cellular respiration in situ under physiological conditions for the organism.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry is the ultimate source of reducing power for phytoplankton primary productivity (PhytoPP). Single turnover active chlorophyll fluorometry (STAF) provides a non-intrusive method that has the potential to measure PhytoPP on much wider spatiotemporal scales than is possible with more direct methods such as 14C fixation and O2 evolved through water oxidation. Application of a STAF-derived absorption coefficient for PSII light-harvesting (aLHII) provides a method for estimating PSII photochemical flux on a unit volume basis (JVPII). Within this study, we assess potential errors in the calculation of JVPII arising from sources other than photochemically active PSII complexes (baseline fluorescence) and the package effect. Although our data show that such errors can be significant, we identify fluorescence-based correction procedures that can be used to minimize their impact. For baseline fluorescence, the correction incorporates an assumed consensus PSII photochemical efficiency for dark-adapted material. The error generated by the package effect can be minimized through the ratio of variable fluorescence measured within narrow wavebands centered at 730 nm, where the re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is minimal, and at 680 nm, where re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is maximal. We conclude that, with incorporation of these corrective steps, STAF can provide a reliable estimate of JVPII and, if used in conjunction with simultaneous satellite measurements of ocean color, could take us significantly closer to achieving the objective of obtaining reliable autonomous estimates of PhytoPP.},

These major gaps in using ocean color to estimate phytoplankton community structure were identified as: (a) the mismatch between satellite, in situ and model data on phytoplankton composition, (b) the lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates provided with satellite data, (c) the spectral limitation of current sensors to enable the full exploitation of backscattered sunlight, and (d) the very limited applicability of satellite algorithms determining phytoplankton composition for regional, especially coastal or inland, waters. Recommendation for actions include but are not limited to: (i) an increased communication and round-robin exercises among and within the related expert groups, (ii) the launching of higher spectrally and spatially resolved sensors, (iii) the development of algorithms that exploit hyperspectral information, and of (iv) techniques to merge and synergistically use the various streams of continuous information on phytoplankton diversity from various satellite sensors' and in situ data to ensure long-term monitoring of phytoplankton composition.},

Three species that reproduced exponentially at all four light intensities in the 14: 10 LD regime did not reproduce at all in continuous light at any of the light intensities. One species, which reproduced at the two lowest light intensities in the 14: 10 LD regime, failed to reproduce at all in continuous light at any light intensity examined. Seven species reproduced more slowly in continuous light than in the 14: 10 LD regime at most or all light intensities. Four species reproduced at roughly the same rate in both light regimes. Five species reproduced more rapidly in continuous light. No general phylogenetic trend could be discerned from the responses of the species to the different light intensities or to continuous light. In general, species from coastal regions can reproduce as rapidly or more rapidly in continuous light than in a 14: 10 LD cycle, while most species from oceanic regions are harmed by continuous light.

As reported, the expression level of Alteromonas enzymes involved in U. prolifera polysaccharides degradation is increased during the green tide outbreak period, potentially accelerating the breakdown of U. prolifera biomass. This enhanced degradation could facilitate the transition to the waning phase of the green tide event. In this study, strain Alteromonas marina OM2201 was isolated from seawater samples taken during an U. prolifera bloom in the coastal waters of Qingdao. Its genome contains a ring chromosome and two plasmids. The length of the circular chromosome was 4,489,073~bp with GC content of 44.21~mol\%, and the length of plasmid 1 was 233,636~bp with GC content of 42.24~mol\%, and the length of plasmid 2 was 5594~bp with GC content of 39.61~mol\%. Genomic analysis showed that Alteromonas marina OM2201 contained a variety of ulvan lyase genes, indicating that it could promote the degradation of U. prolifera polysaccharides. This genetic makeup potentially enables the strain to expedite the decomposition of U. prolifera biomass. Therefore, this study broadens our understanding of the Alteromonas bacteria that can degrade U. prolifera polysaccharides during the outbreak period.},

UV-B radiation could inhibit the growth of Ulva pertusa and Heterosigma akashiwo when they were mono-cultured, and the growth inhibition was more significant with the increased doses of UV-B radiation treatment. The effects of UV-B radiation on the growth of Ulva pertusa were not significant when they were mixed-cultured. But UV-B radiation could inhibit the growth of Heterosigma akashiwo, and the growth inhibition was more significant with the increased doses of UV-B radiation treatment.},

  abstract = {In Lake Biwa, picocyanobacteria blooms usually occur during the summer--autumn thermal stratification period. Intriguingly, a novel bloom was detected in winter 2015--2016, in which picocyanobacterial cell density increased by one order of magnitude despite lower water temperature, suggesting the possibility that ``cold-water-preference'' species dominate in the picocyanobacterial community. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of picocyanobacteria in Lake Biwa by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the picocyanobacterial community were highly diverse in Lake Biwa, with eight Synechococcus-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in different seasons. These OTUs fell into distinct phylogenetic groups, and the majority were closely related to clusters reported previously. Notably, OTU04, detected during the winter bloom, was highly affiliated with sequences found in a variety of lakes, such as Tibetan lakes and Lake Superior, where the water bodies generally have a low trophic state and temperature, and different concentrations of total dissolved solids. Thus, we inferred that the group containing OTU04 may be a psychrotolerant lineage that is widely distributed in oligotrophic water systems with low--intermediate salinity.},

We discussed phenotypic diversity of Pcy in conjunction with a genotypic approach in order to resolve whether a similar morphology also reflects a phylogenetic relationship. Microcolonies of different size (from 5 to 50 cells) constitute a gradient without a net separation from single-celled types and should be considered Pcy, as transition forms from single-cell to colonial morphotypes. The single-celled Pcy populations tend to be predominant in large, deep oligo-mesotrophic lakes, while the CPcy find optimal conditions in warmer, shallower and more nutrient rich lakes. The knowledge of Pcy diversity in pelagic and littoral zone habitats is a key to understand the dominance of certain genotypes in the water column and of their ubiquity. We devoted some paragraphs to analyse the factors (biotic and abiotic) which can influence the dynamics of the different Pcy forms and we have approached the study of their common ecology.},

Synechococcus, the focus of this review, is one of the prevalent genera in the order Chroococcales, common in oceans and lakes and characterized by a coccoid unicellular or microcolony morphology. The evolution of its phycobilisomes is the key of the adaptation of this tiny photosynthetic cell to different light regimes and environmental conditions. Furthermore, Synechococcus strains are widely distributed from the equator to the poles, showing an extreme adaptability to high and low temperatures. Because of their structural plasticity and ecological adaptability, these cyanobacteria are particularly interesting in the current condition of fast climate change. Moreover, picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus genus have a potentially vast impact on global cycles thanks to their significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems. As increasing abundances are predicted for this genus worldwide, and in light of the connection between cyanobacteria and global change events, a better characterization of these organisms promises important and timely ecological insights. Here, I will summarize the morphological and genetic characteristics of Synechococcus strains and their distribution in freshwater lakes, also considering its marine counterpart.},

Vegetative filaments differentiate motile, gas-vacuolated hormogonia after transfer to fresh medium and incubation under red light. Hormogonia are transient and give rise to vegetative filaments, or to heterocystous filaments if fixed nitrogen is lacking. If incubated under green light after transfer to fresh medium, vegetative filaments do not differentiate hormogonia but may produce heterocysts directly, even in the presence of combined nitrogen. We used inhibitors of thylakoid electron transport (3-[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-1,1-dimethylurea and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone) to show that the opposing effects of red and green light on cell differentiation arise through differential excitations of photosystems I and II. Red light excitation of photosystem I oxidizes the plastoquinone pool, stimulating differentiation of hormogonia and inhibiting heterocyst differentiation. Conversely, net reduction of plastoquinone by green light excitation of photosystem II inhibits differentiation of hormogonia and stimulates heterocyst differentiation. This photoperception mechanism is distinct from the light regulation of complementary chromatic adaptation of phycobilisome constituents. Although complementary chromatic adaptation operates independently of the photocontrol of cellular differentiation, these two regulatory processes are linked, because the general expression of phycobiliprotein genes is transiently repressed during hormogonium differentiation. In addition, absorbance by phycobilisomes largely determines the light wavelengths that excite photosystem II, and thus the wavelengths that can imbalance electron transport.}

  abstract = {During acclimated growth in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 a substantial proportion of the electrons extracted from water by photosystem II ultimately flow back to oxygen. This flow increases rapidly under high light, which allows Synechococcus to maintain photosystem II centers largely open, even under excessive excitation. The electron flow to oxygen with increasing light accounts for the progressive discrepancy between the light response curve of measured oxygen evolution, and the light response curve of photosystem II activity estimated from fluorescence measures. In cells under anoxia this flexible electron sink is lost and photosystem II centers suffer partial closure at the growth light intensity, with closure becoming more severe under excess light. As predicted from earlier work this PSII closure results in rapid loss of psbAI message, encoding the D1:1 protein of PSII, and induction of psbAII/AIII encoding the alternate D1:2 protein. The changes in the mRNA pool are not, however, reflected at the protein level, and D1:1 remains in the thylakoid membranes. There is no accumulation of D1:2, despite some continued synthesis of other proteins. PSII closure, therefore, results in repression of psbAI and induction psbAII/AIII expression, but D1:1/D1:2 exchange is blocked by anoxia, downstream from transcription. D1:1 protein and PSII activity are quite stable under anoxia and moderate illumination. Nevertheless, upon recovery under oxygenic conditions, the existing D1:1 is lost from the membranes, resulting in a transient drop in PSII activity. This suggests that under normal conditions the cells use oxygen to facilitate preemptive turnover of D1 proteins.},

Three cell populations were discriminated by flow cytometry: Prochlorococcus prochlorophytes, Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryotes. Prochlorococcus were the most abundant component (maximum ca 2 {\texttimes} 105 cells ml-1). Unlike previous reports, their concentration was almost constant down to roughly 100 m, with a slight maximum at the surface or near the chlorophyll maximum. Cellular chlorophyll fluorescence increased 50-fold between surface and deep populations. One distinguishing feature of the community off Hawaii was the co-occurrence near the chlorophyll maximum of at least two distinct Prochlorococcus populations with different chlorophyll and DNA contents. Throughout the year, Synechococcus abundance was two orders of magnitude lower and there was no seasonal alteration between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as observed in the northern Sargasso Sea. Synechococcus populations did not extend below 120 m and were dominated by high phycourobilin cell types. Picoeukaryote abundance was quite similar to that of Synechococcus, but these cells extended deeper in the water column. Their chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited much less depth variation than Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. Seasonal variability was small ({$<$}2- to 3-fold) for all three components of the picoplankton, not only for cell abundance but also for cellular parameters such as light scatter or pigment fluorescence. Synechococcus populations exhibited the largest seasonal changes (e.g. abundance maximum and chlorophyll fluorescence varied 3-fold). Picoplankton community structure in the Pacific Ocean appears to be distinct from previous reports for other areas. In comparing station ALOHA to the Atlantic Ocean (especially the Sargasso Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea, depth-integrated abundances of Prochlorococcus were higher, that of Synechococcus were lower, and that of picoeukaryotes were similar. We believe this structure, dominated by Prochlorococcus, may be typical for subtropical open-ocean regions.},

In San Antonio Bay (North Patagonia, Argentina), increased nutrients have led to Ulva spp. blooms in spring and early summer, coinciding with high Ulva spp. micropropagules (MPU) density at low tide. This study aimed to describe the variation in MPU densities throughout a year and in a tidal cycle\&amp;nbsp;and their relationship with environmental variables. For this, MPU density, macroalgal biomass, weight of mature and immature thalli, and seawater physical and chemical variables were determined: 1) monthly for a year at low tide, 2) during a tidal cycle at one-hour intervals covering the low tide period (approx. five hours), and 3) at different depths in the water column during daytime and nighttime high tides. Maximum MPU density (33983{\textpm}9553 cel ml-1) occurred in February, while macroalgal biomass peaked in December. MPU density, seawater temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, and nutrients increased during low tide but decreased at high tide, with no evidence of vertical stratification. MPU density was positively associated with seawater temperature during low tide and throughout the year. We conclude that MPU variation is associated with seawater temperature annually and with tidal action daily. High MPU densities during summer raise chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen levels, while tidal flow dilutes and exports MPU. These results provide insights into the dynamics of the dispersal phase of an opportunistic and globally distributed green algal genus for the first time.},

  abstract = {The cyanobacteria are a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis and are thought to be responsible for the oxygenation of our atmosphere. Like red algae and cryptomonads, cyanobacteria also contain phycobiliproteins (PBPs) which serve as major accessory pigments during photosynthesis. PBPs are large water-soluble supramolecular protein aggregates involved in light harvesting and can be divided broadly into three classes, viz., phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC), and allophycocyanin (APC) based on their spectral properties. PBPs have been extracted and purified from Spirulina spp., Synechococcus sp., Oscillatoria sp., etc., and produced commercially from Spirulina platensis, Anabaena sp., and Galdieria sulphuraria. Since cyanobacteria exhibit wide variations in nutrient availability, light intensity, light quality (wavelength), temperature, water activity, etc., these variations also result in altered metabolic activity of these organisms as a result of differential expression of different genes. The expression of phycobiliprotein coding genes is also accordingly modulated to adapt to a particular condition. Many workers have reported changes in phycobilisome structure and expression of cpc genes in response to light quality, light quantity, and nutrients like nitrogen, sulfur, etc. The composition and function of phycobiliproteins in cyanobacteria have also been reported to change under stress conditions. In the present paper, we have reviewed the production, purification, and regulation of cyanobacterial phycobilins including their importance in the commercial sector, as they have several applications as natural dyes in food and cosmetic industry, immunological assays, health-promoting properties, and broad range of other pharmaceutical applications.},

These might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative fish pathogenic bacteria.},

  abstract = {Although the direct involvement of nitrogen and phosphorus has been shown, eutrophication remains poorly managed to this day. The excessive growth of some opportunist seaweeds is the consequence in coastal ecosystems close to agricultural or strongly urbanized and industrialized zones. In Brittany, a leading tourist region of France, green tides set down on the beaches big quantities of Ulva, of which some 100,000 m3 are harvested annually, with significant ecological and economic consequences. In Florida, although the macroalgae (notably Codium) drift about with the currents, they are of sufficient mass and spread over such areal extent to inhibit penetration of sunlight through the water column to the coral reef surface. They strand also on the beaches. Stabilization of algae by composting and methanization of hydrolyzed and pressed algae juice are two methods which have been studied in Brittany and can be used to enhance the value of the harvested seaweed, depending on local conditions and on evolution of needs in energy, basic materials or organic products. But the parallel made here between two very different ecosystems, both disturbed, leads above all to the question of what course to follow now to avoid a worldwide disaster.

The objective was to estimate variations in succession, cover, recruitment and length of Ulva species in four blooms and assess their relationship with environmental parameters in Bah{\'i}a de La Paz, Baja California Sur. At each locality, monthly samplings were performed to register the presence, recruitment, length and cover of species, and temperature, salinity, turbidity and nutrient concentration in surface seawater from February 2013 to October 2015. The species found were Ulva acanthophora, Ulva clathratha, Ulva intestinalis, Ulva flexuosa, Ulva lactuca, Ulva lobata, Ulva nematoidea and Ulva rigida . The Ulva blooms in Casa del Marino, San Juan de la Costa and El Tecolote were multi-species, with U. rigida displaying the highest presence, cover and recruitment, followed by U. acanthophora . Significant differences were found between localities, years and months for biological and environmental factors. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significant relationships between higher cover, recruitment and length with higher nutrients concentrations at San Juan de La Costa, Casa del Marino and El Tecolote, indicating favourable conditions that allowed rapid growth. The cover, recruitment and length of U. flexuosa at El Portugu{\'e}s were inversely correlated with temperature.},

However, the metabolic adaptations of this genus to eddy-associated environmental changes have rarely been studied. We recovered two high-quality Synechococcus metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from eddies in the South China Sea and compared their metabolic variations using metatranscriptomic samples obtained at the same time. The two MAGs (syn-bin1 and syn-bin2) are affiliated with marine Synechococcus subclusters 5.2 (S5.2) and 5.3 (S5.3), respectively. The former exhibited a higher abundance at the surface layer, whereas the latter was more abundant in the deep euphotic layer. Further analysis indicated that syn-bin1 had a strong ability to utilize organic nutrients, which could help it to thrive in the nutrient-deprived surface water. By contrast, syn-bin2 had the genetic potential to perform chromatic acclimation, which could allow it to capture green or blue light at different depths. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis showed that syn-bin2 upregulated genes involved in the synthesis of C4 acids, photosystem II proteins, and transporters in the deep euphotic layer, which might contribute to its predominance in low-light environments. Overall, this study expands our understanding of oceanic S5.2 and S5.3 Synechococcus by revealing their metabolic adaptations to mesoscale eddies.},

For example, Synechococcus is restricted to the first 100 m, whereas Prochlorococcus extends much deeper in oligotrophic waters. This is in part explained by differences in adaptation to nutrient and light regimes. However, they could also be subjected to different predation rates. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the consumption of these two picoplankters by an algivorous ciliate, Strombidium sulcatum, and a bactivorous ciliate, Uronema sp. For both ciliate species, removal rates were higher, by a factor of 3 to 10, for Synechococcus compared to Prochlorococcus when prey items were presented alone or together. The growth of the two ciliates fed Synechococcus and/or Prochlorococcus also differed. S. sulcatum grew well on both prey items, whether alone or together, whereas Uronema sp. grew slowly when fed Synechococcus and very poorly when fed Prochlorococcus either alone or with Synechococcus. Our results suggest that Prochlorococcus may be less subject to ciliate predation than Synechococcus.},

The 10-fold increase in the chlorophyll a concentration (from 0.4 to 4.0 mg/m3) during a diatom/ dinoflagellate bloom leads to a decrease in water transparency and a narrowing of the photosynthesis zone. As a consequence, the average PAR within the phytoplankton habitat layer is almost halved. A diatom/dinoflagellate bloom is accompanied by changes in the downwelling irradiance spectrum at the same PAR level (optical depths). The penetrating irradiance maximum near the bottom of the euphotic zone shifts to longer wavelengths ({\textasciitilde}550--600 nm) as compared to background conditions ({\textasciitilde}500--550 nm). The increase in diatom/dinoflagellate biomass and the concomitant change in the downwelling irradiance spectrum are accompanied by a decrease in the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigments up to about three times that under background conditions at the same optical depths. The downwelling irradiance spectrum at fixed optical depths and the ability of cells to absorb light change slightly as compared to background conditions when coccolithophores bloom.},

  abstract = {The large, sparse arrays of species counts arising in both field and experimental community studies do not lend themselves to standard statistical tests based on multivariate normality. Instead, a valid and more revealing approach uses informal display methods, such as clustering or multi-dimensional scaling ordination (MDS), based on a biologically-motivated definition of pairwise similarity of samples in terms of species composition. Formal testing methods are still required, however, to establish that real assemblage differences exist between sites, times, experimental treatments, pollution states, etc. Earlier work has described a range of Manteltype permutation or randomisation procedures, making no distributional assumptions, which are termed ANOSIM tests because of their dependence only on (rank) similarities and the analogy to one and two-way ANOVA. This paper extends these tests to cover an important practical case, previously unconsidered, that of a two-way layoutwithout replication. Such cases arise for single samples (or pseudo-replicates) taken in a baseline monitoring survey of several sites over time, or a mesocosm experiment in which ``treatments'' are replicated only once within each experimental ``block''. Significance tests are given for the overall presence of a treatment (or time) effect, based on a measure of concordance between rank similarities of samples within each block (or site); the role of the two factors can be reversed to obtain a test for block effects. As in the analogous univariate ANOVA test, the method relies on absence or relative weakness of treatment x block ``interactions''. Its scope is illustrated with data from two experimental and two field studies, involving meiofaunal communities from soft-sediment and macro-algal habitats. It is seen also to accommodate a modest derree of missing data. Whilst the failure to replicate adequately is not encouraged---a richer inference is available with genuine replication---the paper does provide a limited way forward for hypothesis testing in the absence of replicates.},

When grown on agar plates with cool white illumination, mutant colonies deficient or devoid of phycoerythrin can be visibly distinguished from the wild type. A total of 25 anomalously pigmented strains were isolated and examined for their ability to chromatically adapt. Based on absorption spectra of cell extracts and on fluorescence emission spectra of intact filaments, we assigned each mutant to one of three classes. In green mutants (16 strains), the photoinduction of phycoerythrin synthesis by green light was lost or impaired, whereas the photorepression of phycocyanin synthesis by green light still functioned as in the wild type. In blue mutants (eight strains), both the ability to photoinduce phycoerythrin synthesis and the ability to photorepress phycocyanin synthesis were lost or impaired. Filaments of blue mutants exhibited a high fluorescence emission at 660 nm. A black mutant (one strain) exhibited partial induction of phycoerythrin and partial repression of phycocyanin in both red and cool white light. From the data, we suggest that in information transduction for chromatic adaptation, early events are common to both phycoerythrin and phycocyanin regulation and that blue mutants possess lesions in these early events. The lesions in green mutants occur in a subsequent branch of the information transduction pathway which is specific for phycoerythrin photoinduction.}

The RC is located in the PSII core which also contains light-harvesting complexes CP43 and CP47. The PSII core of plants is surrounded by external light-harvesting complexes (lhcs) forming supercomplexes, which together with additional external lhcs, are located in the thylakoid membrane where they perform their functions. In this paper we provide an overview of the available information on the structure and organization of pigment-protein complexes in PSII and relate this to experimental and theoretical results on excitation energy transfer (EET) and charge separation (CS). This is done for different subcomplexes, supercomplexes, PSII membranes and thylakoid membranes. Differences in experimental and theoretical results are discussed and the question is addressed how results and models for individual complexes relate to the results on larger systems. It is shown that it is still very difficult to combine all available results into one comprehensive picture.},

Only near-surface observations are common to both remote sensing and in situ observation, so it is critical to understand processes in the upper euphotic zone. Unfortunately, the biological principles that must be used to interpret optical variability near the sea surface are weaker than we would like, because relatively few experiments and analyses have examined bio-optical relationships under high irradiance characteristic of the upper optical depth. Special consideration of this stratum is justified, because there is good evidence that bio-optical relationships are altered near the surface: (1) the fluorescence yield from chlorophyll declines, leading to bias in the estimation of pigment from fluorometry; (2) the modeled relationship between solar-stimulated fluorescence and photosynthesis seems to deviate significantly from that presented for the lower euphotic zone; and (3) carbon-specific and cellular attenuation cross sections of phytoplankton change substantially during exposures to bright light. Even the measurement of primary productivity is problematic near the sea surface, because vertical mixing is not simulated and artifactual inhibition of photosynthesis can result. These problems can be addressed by focusing more sampling effort, experimental simulation, and analytical consideration on the upper optical depth and by shortening timescales for the measurement of marine photosynthesis. Special efforts to study near-surface processes are justified, because new bio-optical algorithms will require quantitative descriptions of the responses of phytoplankton to bright light.},

  abstract = {Macroalgal blooms of Ulva lactuca and Hypnea musciformis have been problematic in shallow coastal waters around agricultural and urbanized regions of Maui, Hawai`i for decades. Observations have highlighted the correspondence between these blooms and elevated nutrient levels from the adjacent land-use, however little evidence exists regarding the effects of nutrient enrichment on the blooming and non-blooming macroalgae in the area. To determine if elevated nutrient levels influence H. musciformis physiology, we conducted a nutrient enrichment (+N, +P, and +N+P) experiment and measured growth, photosynthetic status, and pigment absorbance. Phycobilin pigments were significantly reduced in the no addition and +P treatment and maintained in those with N additions, suggesting that H. musciformis can use phycobilins to store N. We conducted a second, larger experiment with additions of secondarily-treated wastewater effluent on the bloom forming species Acanthophora spicifera, H. musciformis, and U. lactuca and the common non-bloom forming species, Dictyota acutiloba. All samples were initially depleted of potential N stores and measured for growth, photosynthetic status, and N uptake rates; H. musciformis and U. lactuca were also assessed for micro nutrient uptake, \% tissue N, and {$\delta$}15N values. Growth rates of D. acutiloba, H. musciformis, and U. lactuca increased with increasing \% wastewater effluent addition and concentrations of TN and NO3- and those of the bloom forming species were 2-fold higher. All species increased photosynthetic capacity and saturation irradiance with increasing \% wastewater effluent addition and concentrations of TN and NO3-. U. lactuca was the most sensitive to low N conditions, evidenced by declines in light capturing efficiency. All species utilized a substantial amount of N over 24h. H. musciformis and U. lactuca also (1) utilized micro nutrients: iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, (2) decreased \% tissue N in low N conditions, (3) increased \% tissue N in response to elevated N conditions, and (4) expressed elevated {$\delta$}15N values with increasing additions of wastewater effluent. These results demonstrate that in Hawai`i, the bloom forming species H. musciformis and U. lactuca, have similar physiological responses to decreased and increased nutrient levels.},

(strain M2) and Oscillatoria splendida (strain L3). Nitrogen deficiency does not affect the cellular content in chlorophyll a, but it causes a selective loss in phycobiliproteins; carotenoid content increases with phycocyanin depletion. The major cellular lipids in both Cyanobacteria studied are monogalactosyl diacylglycerol, digalactosyl diacylglycerol, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol. The fatty acid composition is particularly interesting as both these filamentous Oscillatoriaceae show important contents in {$\alpha$}- and {$\gamma$}-linolenic (18:3) and parinaric (18:4) acids. This seems to be very unusual in Cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on the physiological conditions and action spectra of complementary chromatic adaptation. Photosynthetic organisms can modulate their relative pigment content in response to changes in either light intensity or light wavelength. Generally, one observes an inverse correlation between light intensity and pigment content---the less light energy available, the more photosynthetic pigments are synthesized by the cells. The effect of light wavelength on the pigment content of the cells, termed complementary chromatic adaptation, appears to be restricted to some cyanobacteria. In this type of adaptation, changes in cell pigmentation in response to specific spectral illuminations result from modifications of the relative amounts of the red-colored phycoerythrin (PE) and the blue-colored phycocyanin (PC), with a predominance of PE in green-light-grown cells and of PC in red-light-grown cells. The regulatory processes involved in complementary chromatic adaptation are controlled by a photoreceptor pigment system which presumably acts at the transcriptional level. The property of photoreversibility of the cyanobacterial photoreceptor resembles that of the phytochrome present in higher plants and algae, although its action maxima are situated at shorter wavelengths in the visible spectrum.}

Colorless polypeptides of lesser molecular weight (30,000-70,000) appeared to be specific constituents of the phycobilisome.

An early study indicated that bioactive substances from this alga inhibit settlement of the polychaete Hydroides elegans (Haswell). It is also predicted that epibiotic bacteria protect this alga from micro- and macrofouling. In this study, bacterial strains from the surface of U. reticulata were isolated and their inhibitive activities on micro- and macrofouling assayed. The strains were identified by 16S rRNA analysis as belonging to the genera Alteromonas , Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio . There was no significant effect of these strains or their extracts (aqueous and ethanol) on the growth of five Vibrio strains isolated from natural biofilm. Two bacterial strains ( Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. 3) were non-toxic to the benthic diatom Nitzschia paleacea (Grunow) while the other five strains caused a low level of mortality. No one bacterial strain was toxic to the larvae of H. elegans . Aqueous extract of one of the isolated bacterial species, i.e. Vibrio sp. 2, significantly ( p {$<$}0.00001) inhibited the settlement and metamorphosis of H. elegans larvae. The putative antifouling compounds have a molecular weight of {$>$}100 kD. On the other hand, biofilm of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 2 and aqueous extract of Vibrio sp. 2 suppressed the settlement of larvae induced by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Other epibiotic bacteria and their extracts had neither inhibitive nor inductive effects on larval settlement of H. elegans . The results indicate that the antifouling mechanism of U. reticulata may be dependent not only on materials from the macroalga itself but also on the epibiotic bacteria on the algal surface.},

The degradation process of fresh {$<$}italic{$>$}U. prolifera{$<$}/italic{$>$} over two months was dominated by the continuous and slow release of DOM, and the concentration of DOM in the water column was hardly observed to decrease within two months. The pre-discomposed-disposal method also significantly altered microbial community structure. The pre-decomposing treatment with microbial complex formulations destroyed {$<$}italic{$>$}U. prolifera{$<$}/italic{$>$} cell tissues and changed its physical state in seawater from floating to fast depositing, and increased the degradation rate by about 14 times. The rapid decomposition of the released bioactive organic matter consumed a substantial amount of dissolved oxygen in local seawater, which has the potential risk of causing local hypoxia and acidification in a short-term.

However, the underlying processes that governed the diversification of these microorganisms and the appearance of niche-related phenotypic traits are just starting to be elucidated. Here, by comparing 81 genomes, including 34 new {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$}, we explored the evolutionary processes that shaped the genomic diversity of picocyanobacteria. Time-calibration of a core-protein tree showed that gene gain/loss occurred at an unexpectedly low rate between the different lineages, with for instance 5.6 genes gained per million years (My) for the major {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} lineage (sub-cluster 5.1), among which only 0.71/My have been fixed in the long term. Gene content comparisons revealed a number of candidates involved in nutrient adaptation, a large proportion of which are located in genomic islands shared between either closely or more distantly related strains, as identified using an original network construction approach. Interestingly, strains representative of the different ecotypes co-occurring in phosphorus-depleted waters ({$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} clades III, WPC1, and sub-cluster 5.3) were shown to display different adaptation strategies to this limitation. In contrast, we found few genes potentially involved in adaptation to temperature when comparing cold and warm thermotypes. Indeed, comparison of core protein sequences highlighted variants specific to cold thermotypes, notably involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and the oxidative stress response, revealing that long-term adaptation to thermal niches relies on amino acid substitutions rather than on gene content variation. Altogether, this study not only deciphers the respective roles of gene gains/losses and sequence variation but also uncovers numerous gene candidates likely involved in niche partitioning of two key members of the marine phytoplankton.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus comprise a numerically and ecologically prominent phytoplankton group, playing a major role in both carbon cycling and trophic networks in all oceanic regions except in the polar oceans. Despite their high abundance in coastal areas, our knowledge of Synechococcus communities in these environments is based on only a few local studies. Here, we use the global metagenome data set of the Ocean Sampling Day (June 21st, 2014) to get a snapshot of the taxonomic composition of coastal Synechococcus communities worldwide, by recruitment on a reference database of 141 picocyanobacterial genomes, representative of the whole Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and Cyanobium diversity. This allowed us to unravel drastic community shifts over small to medium scale gradients of environmental factors, in particular along European coasts. The combined analysis of the phylogeography of natural populations and the thermophysiological characterization of eight strains, representative of the four major Synechococcus lineages (clades I to IV), also brought novel insights about the differential niche partitioning of clades I and IV, which most often co-dominate the Synechococcus community in cold and temperate coastal areas. Altogether, this study reveals several important characteristics and specificities of the coastal communities of Synechococcus worldwide. IMPORTANCE Synechococcus is the second most abundant phytoplanktonic organism on Earth, and its wide genetic diversity allowed it to colonize all the oceans except for polar waters, with different clades colonizing distinct oceanic niches. In recent years, the use of global metagenomics data sets has greatly improved our knowledge of ``who is where'' by describing the distribution of Synechococcus clades or ecotypes in the open ocean. However, little is known about the global distribution of Synechococcus ecotypes in coastal areas, where Synechococcus is often the dominant phytoplanktonic organism. Here, we leverage the global Ocean Sampling Day metagenomics data set to describe Synechococcus community composition in coastal areas worldwide, revealing striking community shifts, in particular along the coasts of Europe. As temperature appears as an important driver of the community composition, we also characterize the thermal preferenda of 8 Synechococcus strains, bringing new insights into the adaptation to temperature of the dominant Synechococcus clades.}

As a new application, it could be used as raw material for carotenoids production. To evaluate this, a literature research was conducted on Ulva spp. carotenoids content, their physiological responses to environmental factors and the experimental processing and analysis used. Ulva spp. carotenoids were identified by analysis of absorption spectra and retention times after chromatography separation; these were lutein, {$\beta$}-carotene, neoxanthin, {$\beta$}-cryptoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Total carotenoids yield depends on the strain and is positively related to biomass growth. The optimization of the cultivation conditions such as light intensity, nutrients concentration, temperature and salinity can improve carotenoids production. In addition, strategies such as selenium or plant hormones addition, exclusion of incident ultraviolet (UV) light (for few days), and brief induction of physiological stress by extreme hyposalinity, temperature variation and CO2 depletion can further increase this yield. The increase of carotenoids after physiological stress induction would constitute a direct response to maintain the photosynthesis rate and/or eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), or indirect, caused by the increase of antioxidant enzymes and other antioxidant metabolites, which would protect them. In this sense, nutrient enrichment is required to cope with oxidative stress. High PAR intensity decrease photosynthetic pigments yield in minutes (and recover after dark period) while photoprotective carotenoids yield remains constant. The activation of the xanthophyll cycle (violaxanthin to zeaxanthin conversion) is dependent on temperature, and can be induced by high light intensity, hypersalinity or desiccation (under dim light). The xanthophyll cycle is the main non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanism in Ulva spp. during the first period of acclimation to high light intensity.},

The diatoms Skeletonema costatum, Chaetoceros compressits and C. debilis , and Rhizosolenia hebetata var. semispina made up the main part of the biomass on 21 March, 28 March and 4 April respectively. A shade adapted diatom society was located at the top of the nutricline in late June with S. costatum , Chaetoceros spp ., and Thalassiosira spp . as the dominant species. The highest assimilation number of eight for the net plankton and four for the ultraplankton were found at the depth of 32\% light intensity on 28 March and 24 May respectively. Linear relationships were found between chlorophyll a and ATP for the different size fractions with regression slopes ranging from 4.3 to 5.8. The total primary production for the period of investigation was calculated to 74 g C m -2 . Light regime and water column stability were decisive factors for the outburst of the first diatom bloom in late March. Grazing on net plankton diatoms increased during late March-early April. Changes in the longshore wind-stress component were found to be essential for the understanding of the bloom dynamics.}

  abstract = {Chromatic adaptation (CA) in cyanobacteria has provided a model system for the study of the environmental control of photophysiology for several decades. All forms of CA that have been examined so far (types II and III) involve changes in the relative contents of phycoerythrin (PE) and/or phycocyanin when cells are shifted from red to green light and vice versa. However, the chromophore compositions of these polypeptides are not altered. Some marine Synechococcus species strains, which possess two PE forms (PEI and PEII), carry out another type of CA (type IV), occurring during shifts from blue to green or white light. Two chromatically adapting strains of marine Synechococcus recently isolated from the Gulf of Mexico were utilized to elucidate the mechanism of type IV CA. During this process, no change in the relative contents of PEI and PEII was observed. Instead, the ratio of the two chromophores bound to PEII, phycourobilin and phycoerythrobilin, is high under blue light and low under white light. Mass spectroscopy analyses of isolated PEII {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-subunits show that there is a single PEII protein type under all light climates. The CA process seems to specifically affect the chromophorylation of the PEII (and possibly PEI) {$\alpha$} chain. We propose a likely process for type IV CA, which involves the enzymatic activity of one or several phycobilin lyases and/or lyase-isomerases differentially controlled by the ambient light quality. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene confirm that type IV CA is not limited to a single clade of marine Synechococcus.}

  abstract = {In marine Synechococcus there is evidence for the adaptive evolution of spectrally distinct forms of the major light harvesting pigment phycoerythrin (PE). Recent research has suggested that these spectral forms of PE have a different evolutionary history than the core genome. However, a lack of explicit statistical testing of alternative hypotheses or for selection on these genes has made it difficult to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between spectral forms of PE or the role horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may have had in the adaptive phenotypic evolution of the pigment system in marine Synechococcus. In this work, PE phylogenies of picocyanobacteria with known spectral phenotypes, including newly co-isolated strains of marine Synechococcus from the Gulf of Mexico, were constructed to explore the diversification of spectral phenotype and PE evolution in this group more completely. For the first time, statistical evaluation of competing evolutionary hypotheses and tests for positive selection on the PE locus in picocyanobacteria were performed. Genes for PEs associated with specific PE spectral phenotypes formed strongly supported monophyletic clades within the PE tree with positive directional selection driving evolution towards higher phycourobilin (PUB) content. The presence of the PUB-lacking phenotype in PE-containing marine picocyanobacteria from cyanobacterial lineages identified as Cyanobium is best explained by HGT into this group from marine Synechococcus. Taken together, these data provide strong examples of adaptive evolution of a single phenotypic trait in bacteria via mutation, positive directional selection and horizontal gene transfer.},

At low photon flux densities, photosynthesis is a linear function of irradiance (E), the number of reaction centers (n), their effective absorption capture cross section (o), and a quantum yield (0) . As photosynthesis becomes increasingly light saturated, an increased fraction of reaction centers close. At light saturation the maximum photosynthetic rate is given as the product of the number o f reaction centers (n) and their maximum electron transport rate (1 It). Using active fluoromctry it is possible to measure non-destructively and in real time the fraction of open or closed reaction centers under ambient irradiance conditions in situ, as well as {$<$}7 and 0 . rcan be readily calculated from knowledge of the light saturation parameter, Ek (which can be deduced in situ by active fluorescence measurements) and a. We built a pump and probe fluorometer, which is interfaced with a CTD. The instrument measures the fluorescence yield of a weak probe flash preceding (F0) and succeeding (Fnl) a saturating pump flash. Profiles of these fluorescence yields are used to derive the instantaneous rate o f gross photosynthesis in natural phytoplankton communities without any incubation. Correlations with shortterm simulated in situ radiocarbon measurements are extremely high. The average slope between photosynthesis derived from fluorescence and that measured by radiocarbon is 1.06 and corresponds to the average photosynthetic quotient. The intercept is about 12\% of the maximum radiocarbon uptake and corresponds to the average net community respiration. Profiles of photosynthesis and sections showing the variability in its composite parameters reveal a significant effect of nutrient availability on photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency in the ocean, independent of phytoplankton species composition.},

However, it was not until the Mesozoic Era (251 to 65 million years ago) that the three principal phytoplankton clades that would come to dominate the modern seas rose to ecological prominence. In contrast to their pioneering predecessors, the dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, and diatoms all contain plastids derived from an ancestral red alga by secondary symbiosis.

A unique example of the effect of specific wavelengths of light on the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus occurs in cyanobacteria that undergo complementary chromatic adaptation. These organisms alter the composition of their light-harvesting organelle, the phycobilisome, and exhibit distinct morphological features as a function of the wavelength of incident light. Fremyella diplosiphon, a filamentous cyanobacterium, responds to green light by activating transcription of the cpeBA operon, which encodes the pigmented light-harvesting component phycoerythrin. We have isolated and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of another operon, cpeCD, that encodes the linker proteins associated with phycoerythrin hexamers in the phycobilisome. The cpeCD operon is activated in green light and expressed as two major transcripts with the same 5' start site but differing 3' ends. Analysis of the kinetics of transcript accumulation in cultures of F. diplosiphon shifted from red light to green light and vice versa shows that the cpeBA and cpeCD operons are regulated coordinately. A common 17-base-pair sequence is found upstream of the transcription start sites of both operons. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the phycoerythrin-associated linker proteins CpeC and CpeD with sequences of other previously characterized rod linker proteins shows 49 invariant residues, most of which are in the amino-terminal half of the proteins.}

Two of the most common macroalgae are mainly Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri. In this article, a novelty method named commission internationale de l'{\'e}clairage (CIE) color space of macroalgae (CIE-M) was developed to distinguish Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri using Sentinel-2 L2A data. First, since Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri have biologically different pigment compositions, the color difference between them was plotted in the CIE color space using data extracted from the Sentinel-2 L2A images. It was found that most of the pixels from Ulva prolifera showed higher CIE\_x and CIE\_y than those of the Sargassum horneri. For practical application, thresholds of 0.345 and 0.35 were chosen for simple binary classification between Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri on satellite images. Second, the developed CIE-M method was compared with the other three previous methods, green algae index, slope of red--green, and Sargassum and Ulva prolifera index. The results showed that our newly developed method has satisfactory extraction results not only in clear region, but also in cloudy, and turbid region. Finally, the monthly spatial variation of Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri during 2019--2023 was analyzed separately, using the Sentinel-2 L2A images. It was found that Ulva prolifera mainly occurred in the YS from late spring to summer seasons, while Sargassum horneri blooms mainly occurred during winter to spring in the ECS and YS, with maximum area in February.},

  abstract = {The element nitrogen (N) constitutes about 5--10\% of the dry weight of a cyanobacterial cell. The purpose of this chapter is to review the assimilatory pathways which in free-living cyanobacteria lead from different extracellular N-sources to cellular N-containing components. Inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium is incorporated into glutamine and glutamate via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle. The glnA gene, encoding glutamine synthetase, has been characterized in a number of cyanobacteria. Glutamate (and glutamine) distribute N to other organic compounds by means of transaminases, and glutamate is itself a precursor of some other nitrogenous metabolites. Ammonium can be taken up from the external medium by the cyanobacterial cell, but it can also be derived from other nutrients, essentially N2, nitrate and urea. Many cyanobacteria are able to fix N2 under aerobic conditions. Strategies for protecting nitrogenase from O2 in cyanobacteria include the temporal separation of nitrogenase activity and photosynthetic O2 evolution, and in some filamentous cyanobacteria, the differentiation of heterocysts (cells specialized in N2 fixation). A detailed characterization of nif genes has only been performed in a heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium. Nitrate reduction has been found to use photosynthetically reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor, and genes encoding nitrate transport and reduction proteins have been identified and shown to constitute an operon. Some amino acids like arginine and glutamine can also contribute N to some cyanobacteria; however, urea and amino acid utilization have been poorly investigated thus far. Pathways of N assimilation in cyanobacteria are induced upon ammonium deprivation, ammonium being the preferred N source. A gene, ntcA, encoding a transcriptional regulator required for expression of proteins subjected to nitrogen control has been identified. A major theme for future research is how information about the N status of the cell is sensed and transduced to the protein(s) effecting regulation of gene expression.},

In regard to temperature there was a broad optimum at 10--15{$^\circ$} C, except inP. umbilicalis, which grew fastest at 10 {$^\circ$}C. A growth peak at this temperature was also found in four of 17 other North Sea macroalgae, for which the growth/temperature response was studied, whereas 13 of these species exhibited a growth optimum at 15 {$^\circ$}C, or a broad optimum at 10--15 {$^\circ$}C. Growth was light-saturated inU. lactuca, L. saccharina andC. crispus at photon flux densities above 70 {\textmu}E m-2s-1, but inP. umbilicalis above 30 {\textmu}E m-2s-1. Growth rate did not decrease notably in the eulittoral species after one week in relatively strong light (250 {\textmu}E m-2s-1), but by about 50 \% in the case of the sublittoralL. saccharina, as compared with growth under weak light conditions (30 {\textmu}E m-2s-1). In contrast, chlorophyll content decreased in the sublittoral as well as in the eulittoral species, and the greatest change in pigment content occurred in the range 30--70 {\textmu}E m-2s-1. Growth rate increased continuously up to photoperiods of 24 h light per day inL. saccharina andC. crispus, whereas daylength saturation occurred at photoperiods of more than 16 h light per day inU. lactuca andP. umbilicalis.},

The interpretation of these measurements in the 2250--4450cm-1 region is being complicated by the presence of HDO lines absorbing radiation in this region. These spectra cannot be modeled properly because line shape parameters for CO2 broadening (principal gas in these atmospheres) of HDO are not available. Here semi-classical line shape calculations for the HDO--CO2 collision system are made using the Robert--Bonamy formalism for some 2300 rotational band transitions of HDO. From these calculations, the half-width, its temperature dependence, and the line shift are determined to aid in the reduction of the measured spectra. These data will greatly reduce the uncertainty of the reduced profiles from the Venus and Mars measurements and will also allow better estimates of the D/H ratio on these planets.},

In general, the specimens reached their highest ETRmax in spring in the Lagoon, but in summer in the Mediterranean, coinciding with their maximum biomass peak. The species exhibited a dynamic photoinhibition. Except C.~compressa, they showed a lower decrease in Fv/Fm and higher recovery rates in the Mediterranean populations when exposed to high irradiance. The higher salinity and temperature of the lagoon could impair the photoprotection mechanisms. The acclimation to lagoon environments is species-specific and involves complex regulatory mechanisms. The results underline the importance of N in repair, avoidance, quenching and scavenging mechanisms. In general, Lagoon specimens showed higher pigment concentration. Although xanthophylls play important photo-protective and antioxidant roles, the observed trend is more likely to be explained by the higher temperatures reached in the lagoon compared to Mediterranean. Therefore the studied photosynthetic and biochemical mechanisms can be effective not only for high irradiance, but also for higher temperatures in a climate change scenario, but are highly dependent on nutrient availability.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a fluorescence, measured in situ, can be applied as a tool to estimate primary production in the ocean over a large range of temporal and spatial scales. This non-invasive technique allows for fast assessments of photo-physiological parameters in contrast to the traditional methodologies (14C uptake and O2 evolution). The main photo-physiological parameters derived by the available instruments are yields, and as such, require careful interpretation. The comprehension of the main sources of variability of the photochemical and the light absorption efficiencies in marine phytoplankton has increased in the past years, largely by studies using monospecific cultures. In natural communities, however, the development of primary production models based on chlorophyll-a fluorescence remain limited as they are simultaneously subjected to a wide range of environmental and biological factors. This study will test the hypothesis that photo-physiological models for primary production estimates can be improved when key phytoplankton features, such as the pigments composition and dominant cell size, are taking into account. The approach was to contrast the photo-physiological parameters derived from measurements in distinct oceanographic regions, as well as those derived in a specific environment with presented different nutrient concentration according to the time of sampling. In addition, we showed for monospecific cultures, how the photo-physiological parameters are quantitatively related to the production of carbon under the interactive effects of taxonomic composition and cell size. The proportions of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments present in the community were related to the bulk photochemical efficiency and the cross-section of light absorption, but varied among oceanographic regions and the depth of the water column. A parameterization of fluorescence-derived primary production rates, using four dominant size classes, was derived for natural phytoplankton communities under different nutrients conditions in a coastal environment, showing that the parameters differed among size classes above a threshold of nutrient concentration. The direct conversion rates between fluorescence-derived primary production and carbon assimilation rates, computed for two distinct phytoplankton cell sizes grown in controlled laboratorial conditions, showed that cell size strongly influences the efficiency of light absorption and photochemistry, however species-specific responses in photosynthetic energy allocation dominated the differences observed in how absorbed light is utilized to carbon assimilation, i.e., in the electron requirements for carbon assimilation. The results highlighted the importance of the tight coupling of nutrients availability and phytoplankton communities, as well as for measurements of chlorophyll-a fluorescence in the ocean and primary production models. This work presents a novel contribution to the increasing efforts to apply fluorescence-based techniques to understand and parameterize primary production estimates in marine systems, especially at highly dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {We review research from the last 40 yr on macroalgal--bacterial interactions. Marine macroalgae have been challenged throughout their evolution by microorganisms and have developed in a world of microbes. Therefore, it is not surprising that a complex array of interactions has evolved between macroalgae and bacteria which basically depends on chemical interactions of various kinds. Bacteria specifically associate with particular macroalgal species and even to certain parts of the algal body. Although the mechanisms of this specificity have not yet been fully elucidated, ecological functions have been demonstrated for some of the associations. Though some of the chemical response mechanisms can be clearly attributed to either the alga or to its epibiont, in many cases the producers as well as the mechanisms triggering the biosynthesis of the biologically active compounds remain ambiguous. Positive macroalgal--bacterial interactions include phytohormone production, morphogenesis of macroalgae triggered by bacterial products, specific antibiotic activities affecting epibionts and elicitation of oxidative burst mechanisms. Some bacteria are able to prevent biofouling or pathogen invasion, or extend the defense mechanisms of the macroalgae itself. Deleterious macroalgal--bacterial interactions induce or generate algal diseases. To inhibit settlement, growth and biofilm formation by bacteria, macroalgae influence bacterial metabolism and quorum sensing, and produce antibiotic compounds. There is a strong need to investigate the bacterial communities living on different coexisting macroalgae using new technologies, but also to investigate the production, localization and secretion of the biological active metabolites involved in those possible ecological interactions.},

The results showed that U. prolifera explants exhibited rapid regeneration mainly through branches at 15, 20 and 25~{$^\circ$}C. Algivore feeding and sporulation (at 20--25~{$^\circ$}C) contributed to mass production of explants. The growth of floating population could be attributed to the coupling of mass production and rapid regeneration of explants through multiple cycles, which accounted for the outbreak of floating green tide. This finding presented a novel population growth model to elucidate macroalgal bloom occurrences.},

  abstract = {High light poses a threat to oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Similar to eukaryotes, cyanobacteria evolved a photoprotective mechanism, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which dissipates excess absorbed energy as heat. An orange carotenoid protein (OCP) has been implicated as a blue-green light sensor that induces NPQ in cyanobacteria. Discovered in vitro, this process involves a light-induced transformation of the OCP from its dark, orange form (OCPo) to a red, active form, however, the mechanisms of NPQ in vivo remain largely unknown. Here we show that the formation of the quenching state in vivo is a multistep process that involves both photoinduced and dark reactions. Our kinetic analysis of the NPQ process reveals that the light induced conversion of OCPo to a quenching state (OCPq) proceeds via an intermediate, non-quenching state (OCPi), and this reaction sequence can be described by a three-state kinetic model. The conversion of OCPo to OCPi is a photoinduced process with the effective absorption cross section of 4.5{\texttimes}10-3{\AA}2 at 470nm. The transition from OCPi to OCPq is a dark reaction, with the first order rate constant of {\textasciitilde}0.1s-1 at 25{$^\circ$}C and the activation energy of 21kcal/mol. These characteristics suggest that the reaction rate may be limited by cis-trans proline isomerization of Gln224--Pro225 or Pro225--Pro226, located at a loop near the carotenoid. NPQ decreases the functional absorption cross-section of Photosystem II, suggesting that formation of the quenched centers reduces the flux of absorbed energy from phycobilisomes to the reaction centers by {\textasciitilde}50\%.},

The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2012 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is composed of five major components: the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity. Moreover, molecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR cross-sections for almost 300 additional molecules important in different areas of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The compilation can be accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user in many ways. It enables the incorporation of an extended set of fundamental parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape formalisms, easy user-defined output formats, and very convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data. A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language (SQL) features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided.},

The time course of degradation processes differs for various photosynthetic pigments, for photosystem I and photosystem II activities and is strongly influenced by the illumination and by the experimental conditions of nutrient deprivation. Under standard experimental conditions of combined nitrogen deprivation, three phases of the differentiation process can be defined. The first phase corresponds to the well-known phycobiliprotein degradation, in phase 2 the cells lose chlorophyll a prior to entering phase 3, the fully differentiated state, in which the cells are still able to regenerate pigmentation after the addition of nitrate to the culture. An analysis of the protein synthesis patterns by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis during nitrogen starvation indicates extensive differential gene expression, suggesting the operation of tight regulatory mechanisms.},

In early summer, the abundance of picocyanobacteria was related to water masses: they were nearly absent in polar water, whereas they occurred in high concentrations (up to 5470 cells ml-1) in Atlantic Water. During autumn and beginning of winter, the abundances of picocyanobacteria remained around 103 cells ml-1. Their relative contribution to total picoplanktonic algal abundance increased from 0\% during spring/summer to 70--80\% in late autumn, as a result of a decrease in the abundance of eucaryotic picoalgae. Consequently, the impact of picocyanobacteria on Arctic epipelagic carbon and energy flow is of minor importance, and the strong contribution of picoplankton algae to biomass and primary productivity in Arctic seas has to be attributed to eucaryotic species.},

Some visually dramatic changes in pigmentation of cyanobacterial cells that occur during changing nutrient and light conditions reflect marked alterations in components of the major light-harvesting complex in these organisms, the phycobilisome. As noted well over 100 years ago, the pigment composition of some cyanobacteria is very sensitive to ambient wavelengths of light; this sensitivity reflects molecular changes in polypeptide constituents of the phycobilisome. The levels of different pigmented polypeptides or phycobiliproteins that become associated with the phycobilisome are adjusted to optimize absorption of excitation energy present in the environment. This process, called complementary chromatic adaptation, is controlled by a bilin-binding photoreceptor related to phytochrome of vascular plants; however, many other regulatory elements also play a role in chromatic adaptation. My perspectives and biases on the history and significance of this process are presented in this essay.},

Deviations resulting from the Dicke narrowing effect were observed between the measured profiles and the standard Voigt profile. The corresponding collision narrowing coefficients were computed using both the soft and hard collision profiles. Self-induced pressure shift coefficients were found to range between -0.08 and +0.05 cm-1/atm.

We focus on findings that suggest that some cyanobacteria may route electrons derived from the splitting of H2O to the reduction of O2 and H+ in a water-to-water cycle, and that other cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen during the day are likely missing PSII and enzymes involved in the fixation of inorganic carbon.

We modulated electron transfer rate and light intensity independently of each other in lincomycin-treated pea leaves and in isolated thylakoids, in order to elucidate the specific effects of light and PSII electron transport on photoinhibition. Major changes in the rate of electron transport caused only small changes in the rate of photoinhibition, suggesting the existence of a significant photoinhibitory pathway that contains an electron-transfer-independent phase. We compared the action spectrum of photoinhibition with absorption spectra of PSII components that could function as photoreceptors of the electron-transfer-independent phase of photoinhibition and found that the absorption spectra of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) compounds resemble the action spectrum of photoinhibition, showing a steep decrease from UV-C to blue light and a low visible-light tail. Our results show that the release of a Mn ion to the thylakoid lumen is the earliest detectable step of both UV- and visible-light-induced photoinhibition. After Mn release from the oxygen-evolving complex, oxidative damage to the PSII reaction center occurs because the Mn-depleted oxygen-evolving complex cannot reduce P680+ normally.},

This study investigated whether exposure to bloom-like concentrations of two Synechococcus strains, CC9311 and CC9902, alters fish behaviour. Black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) were exposed to Synechococcus strain CC9311 or CC9902 (1.5\>{\texttimes}\>106\>cells\>ml-1) or to control seawater in experimental aquaria for 3\>days. Fish movement inside a testing arena was then recorded and analysed using video camera-based motion-tracking software. Compared with control fish, fish exposed to CC9311 demonstrated a significant preference for the dark zone of the tank in the light--dark test, which is an indication of increased anxiety. Furthermore, fish exposed to CC9311 also had a statistically significant decrease in velocity and increase in immobility and they meandered more in comparison to control fish. There was a similar trend in velocity, immobility and meandering in fish exposed to CC9902, but there were no significant differences in behaviour or locomotion between this group and control fish. Identical results were obtained with a second batch of fish. Additionally, in this second trial we also investigated whether fish would recover after a 3\>day period in seawater without cyanobacteria. Indeed, there were no longer any significant differences in behaviour among treatments, demonstrating that the sp. CC9311-induced alteration of behaviour is reversible. These results demonstrate that blooms of specific marine Synechococcus strains can induce differential sublethal effects in fish, namely alterations light--dark preference behaviour and motility.},

Nostoc flagelliforme is a terrestrial filamentous cyanobacterium that has distinct phycobilisome composition consisting of phycocyanin (PC) and allophycocyanin (APC). The photoregulation process of N. flagelliforme was explored by investigating the effects of different light colors on photosynthetic pigments, which were determined after photoautotrophic growth with red (RL), yellow (YL), green (GL), blue (BL), purple (PL) and white (WL) light of same photosynthetically active photon flux density. Compared with WL, YL, GL, BL and PL changed the amounts of pigments but did not alter the cellular ratio of PC/APC; while RL altered both the amounts and proportions of PC and APC. The observations by confocal laser scanning microscope and transmission electron microscope showed that PC, APC and chlorophyll a were distributed throughout the cells under GL, BL, PL, and WL illumination but located in the outermost layer in RL and YL-grown cells. Further study revealed that changing RL intensity would not influence the ratio of PC/APC but the distribution of pigments shifted from central cytoplasmic region to the periphery of the cells with the increase of intensity. These results implied that N. flagelliforme responded to RL by regulating the composition and location of phycobilisomes and these findings would be of importance to develop the high-efficient process of N. flagelliforme culture.},

Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon.

  abstract = {Synechococcus is a cosmopolitan genus of picocyanobacteria living in the photic zone of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon. This separation was largely consistent with the phycobiliprotein composition of the different BSea strains. The majority of phycocyanin (PC)-rich Bsea strains clustered with WH5701.

The model incorporates multi-spectral optics and light absorption properties for the different phytoplankton. The model successfully reproduced observed vertical gradients in the nitrate, bulk phytoplankton properties and community structure. Model phytoplankton types with Synechococcus-like spectral light absorption properties were outcompeted at depth, where eukaryote-like spectral properties were advantageous. In contrast, photoinhibition was important for vertical separation of high-light and low-light Prochlorococcus model analogues. In addition, temperature dependence was important for selection of phytoplankton types on the temperature gradient. The fittest, or successful, phytoplankton types were characterised by combinations of simultaneously optimal traits that suited them to a particular depth in the water column, reflecting the view that phytoplankton have co-evolved multiple traits that are advantageous in a particular environmental condition or niche.},

A total of ten pigment groups were considered to represent three Phytoplankton Size Classes (PSCs, micro-, nano- and picoplankton) and seven Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs, i.e. diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, prymnesiophytes (haptophytes), pico-eukaryotes, prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.). The observed relationships between Chl-a and PSCs/PFTs were well-defined at the global scale to show that a community shift of phytoplankton at the basin and global scales is reflected by a change in Chl-a of the total community. Thus, Chl-a of the total community can be used as an index of not only phytoplankton biomass but also of their community structure. Within these relationships, we also found non-monotonic variations with Chl-a for certain pico-sized phytoplankton (pico-eukaryotes, Prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.) and nano-sized phytoplankton (Green algae, prymnesiophytes). The relationships were quantified with a least-square fitting approach in order to enable an estimation of the PFTs from Chl-a where PFTs are expressed as a percentage of the total Chl-a. The estimated uncertainty of the relationships depends on both PFT and Chl-a concentration. Maximum uncertainty of 31.8\% was found for diatoms at Chl-a = 0.49 mg m-3. However, the mean uncertainty of the relationships over all PFTs was 5.9\% over the entire Chl-a range observed in situ (0.02 \&lt; Chl-a \&lt; 4.26 mg m\&minus;3). The relationships were applied to SeaWiFS satellite Chl-a data from 1998 to 2009 to show the global climatological fields of the surface distribution of PFTs. Results show that microplankton are present in the mid and high latitudes, constituting only {\textasciitilde}10.9\% of the entire phytoplankton community in the mean field for 1998--2009, in which diatoms explain {\textasciitilde}7.5\%. Nanoplankton are ubiquitous throughout the global surface oceans, except the subtropical gyres, constituting {\textasciitilde}45.5\%, of which prymnesiophytes (haptophytes) are the major group explaining {\textasciitilde}31.7\% while green algae contribute {\textasciitilde}13.9\%.

Carbon-specific uptake rates equalled cell specific growth rates for a minimum of 3 h at high light intensity (636 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}). Low molecular weight (LMW) compounds were linearly labelled for up to 4 h under constant high light and accounted for nearly 70 \% of total {$^{14}$}C fixed. Chloroform-soluble (lipid) and TCA-soluble (polysaccharide) fractions were uniformly labelled for only 2 h, accounting for 9 to 15 \% of total {$^{14}$}C fixed. Under low light intensity (30 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}), the proportion of {$^{14}$}C decreased in the LMW, chloroform-soluble and TCA-soluble fractions, but increased in particulate materials relative to that occurring at high light. There was an increase in the carbon fixation rates of LMW, chloroform-soluble, and particulate fractions when these cells were re-exposed to high light; carbon partitioning into the TCA-soluble fraction was initially suppressed, but recovered within 30 to 60 min. After 2 h of alternating 30 min exposures to high and low light, cells lost the ability to maintain a carbon fixation rate at 636 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$} equivalent to that found in control cultures. Carbon fixation into LMW, chloroform-soluble, and TCA-soluble fractions under fluctuating irradiance occurred only at high light, while protein labeling was unaffected. Based on these metabolic patterns, it appears that short-term (15 to 30 min) light fluctuations in situ may have a major influence on the pattern of carbon partitioning in marine phytoplankton.}

We recently proposed the ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to reduce computing time while achieving more unbiased branch supports than SBS under mild model violations. UFBoot has been steadily adopted as an efficient alternative to SBS and other bootstrap approaches. Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets. UFBoot2 is implemented in the IQ-TREE software package version 1.6 and freely available at http://www.iqtree.org.}

Two pre-acclimation regimes were used, Vita-Lite as controls (530-- 700 nm peak) and blue light as experimentals (430-- 460 nm peak) prior to the mating experiments. In blue light, an increase in the number of matings and spherical cells (spheres) produced in the life cycle was observed as the photoperiod increased. This implies that longer photoperiods of blue light are more optimal for sexual reproduction in Chloromonas sp.-D than shorter ones. Under Vita-Lite, there was a significant increase in the number of matings and spheres with the extended 20 : 4 photoperiod compared with the shorter 14 : 10 photoperiod. Under blue light, significantly more matings and spheres occurred than under Vita-Lite using the same irradiance level of 95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1 (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] of 400-- 700 nm) for the 14 : 10 and 20 : 4 photoperiods. The results of these experiments suggest that Chloromonas sp.-D, known only from the Tughill Plateau, NY, is not reproducing optimally at this site where it grows and reproduces under an approximate 14 : 10 photoperiod in early April. However, in the upper 10 cm of snow in the Tughill Plateau, a blue light irradiance level of 95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1 occurs, which is optimal for this species. When these conditions are combined with a 14 : 10 photoperiod, the Tughill Plateau appears to be sub-optimal for mating and production of spherical cells. Since Chloromonas sp.-D does not appear to have a dependence on a dark cycle, this would allow it to expand its geographical distribution. It may reproduce more optimally under blue light (95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1) with an extended photoperiod ({$>$}20 : 4 h, light:dark) in high latitude field sites such as Lake Bienville, Qu{\'e}bec, in eastern North America where other species of Chloromonas are known in snow associated with coniferous forests.

Cyanobacteria have evolved a diverse set of phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) that allow cells to respond to light in the range from {$\sim$}300nm to {$\sim$}750nm. Together with associated response regulators, these photosensory proteins control many aspects of cyanobacterial physiology and metabolism. These include far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP), complementary chromatic acclimation (CCA), low-light photoacclimation (LoLiP), photosystem content and stoichiometry (long-term adaptation), short-term acclimation (state transitions), circadian rhythm, phototaxis, photomorphogenesis/development, and cellular aggregation. This minireview highlights some discoveries concerning phytochromes and CBCRs as well as two acclimation processes that improve light harvesting and energy conversion under specific irradiance conditions: FaRLiP and CCA.}

Previous work suggested that these absorption properties of water create a series of spectral niches but the theory was still too simplified to enable prediction of the spectral niches in real aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show with a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model that the vibrational modes of the water molecule delineate five spectral niches, in the violet, blue, green, orange and red parts of the spectrum. These five niches are effectively captured by chlorophylls and phycobilin pigments of cyanobacteria and their eukaryotic descendants. Global distributions of the spectral niches are predicted by satellite remote sensing and validated with observed large-scale distribution patterns of cyanobacterial pigment types. Our findings provide an elegant explanation for the biogeographical distributions of photosynthetic pigments across the lakes and oceans of our planet.},

To resemble algal bloom scenarios, analyses were conducted in mono- and/or co-cultures of the bloom-forming species Skeletonema costatum, Scrippsiella trochoidea, Ulva fasciata, and Corallina officinalis during their active growth phase. The study revealed that S. costatum exhibited higher production of the dominant AAs than S. trochoidea. Alanine, lysine, and threonine acids are the dominant amino acids in S. costatum and S. trochoidea filtrates, which may play a role in mucus formation during mucosal phytoplankton blooms with negative ecological effects. On the other hand, aspartic, glutamine, alanine, and leucine acids are the dominant amino acids in macroalgae. In co-culture experiments, U. fasciata shows strong and rapid allelopathic activity against these two potentially harmful species. The AA production offers an advantage to species with the capacity to absorb them to form blooms. Thus, anthropogenic inorganic nutrient inputs may be less important for the development of algal blooms in coastal waters. A major difference that distinguishes this work from others is the use of specific multi-taxa cultures of phytoplankton and macroalgae. The study represents a new research effort in Alexandria waters.}

Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) provides a potential means to realize this goal with unprecedented resolution and scale yet has not become the ``go-to'' method despite high expectations. A major obstacle is difficulty converting electron transfer rates to equivalent rates of C-fixation most relevant for studies of biogeochemical C-fluxes. Such difficulty stems from methodological inconsistencies and our limited understanding of how the electron requirement for C-fixation ({$\Phi$}e,C) is influenced by the environment and by differences in the composition and physiology of phytoplankton assemblages. We outline a ``roadmap'' for limiting methodological bias and to develop a more mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiology underlying {$\Phi$}e,C. We 1) re-evaluate core physiological processes governing how microalgae invest photosynthetic electron transport-derived energy and reductant into stored carbon versus alternative sinks. Then, we 2) outline steps to facilitate broader uptake and exploitation of FRRf, which could transform our knowledge of aquatic primary productivity. We argue it is time to 3) revise our historic methodological focus on carbon as the currency of choice, to 4) better appreciate that electron transport fundamentally drives ecosystem biogeochemistry, modulates cell-to-cell interactions, and ultimately modifies community biomass and structure.}

  abstract = {Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis. Yet, most phytoplankton species are heavier than water and therefore sink. How can these sinking species persist? Somehow, the answer should lie in the turbulent motion that redisperses sinking phytoplankton over the vertical water column. Here, we show, using a reaction-advection-diffusion equation of light-limited phytoplankton, that there is a turbulence window sustaining sinking phytoplankton species in deep waters. If turbulent diffusion is too high, phytoplankton are mixed to great depths, and the depth-averaged light conditions are too low to allow net positive population growth. Conversely, if turbulent diffusion is too low, sinking phytoplankton populations end up at the ocean floor and succumb in the dark. At intermediate levels of turbulent diffusion, however, phytoplankton populations can outgrow both mixing rates and sinking rates. In this way, the reproducing population as a whole can maintain a position in the well-lit zone near the top of the water column, even if all individuals within the population have a tendency to sink. This theory unites earlier classic results by Sverdrup and Riley as well as our own recent findings and provides a new conceptual framework for the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics under the influence of mixing processes.},

Rhizoidal cells bear tubular extensions on the outside of the cell layer in the stipe.               Ulva limnetica               is distinguished from species with similar thalli by chloroplast disposition, branching pattern, number of pyrenoids per cell and gross morphology. It is also distinguished by sequences of the nuclear-encoded 18S ribosomal RNA gene, internal transcribed spacer 2 region and the plastid-encoded large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxgenase gene (               rbc               L).

Besides, we assess the chemical composition of bioactive compounds. For this purpose,               Ulva rigida               was seasonally collected from two northern sites in Tunisia, Cap Zebib rocky shore (CZ) and Ghar El Melh lagoon (GEM). Crude organic extracts were prepared using dichloromethane and dichloromethane/methanol and tested against 19 indicator microorganisms using the disk diffusion method and microdilution technique to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Silica gel column and thin layer chromatography were used for purification of active compounds. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography were used for compounds identification. Samples of               Ulva rigida               collected from the two sites have uniform antimicrobial activity throughout the year. Algae collected from the lagoon showed the largest spectrum of activity and were used for subsequent analysis. Bioguided purification of extracts from               Ulva rigida,               collected at GEM, leads to 16 active fractions with antibacterial effect mainly against               Staphylococcus aureus               ATCC 25923 and               Enterococcus faecalis               ATCC 29212. These fractions were identified as fatty acids, mainly oleic (C18: 1 w9), linoleic (C18: 2 w6), palmitic (C16: 0), and stearic (C14: 0). MICs values ranged from 10 to 250               {$\mu$}               g/ml.},

The cultures were carried out at temperatures of 35{$^\circ$}C, air enriched with carbon dioxide at concentrations of 15\% and photon flux density of 150{$\mu$}molm-2s-1. The light cycles evaluated were 0:24, 2:22, 4:20, 6:18, 8:16, 10:14, 12:12, 14:10, 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, 22:2 and 24:0 (night:day), respectively. The results obtained indicated that the duration of the light periods was a determinant factor in the performance of the photobioreactors. A linear reduction in biomass production and carbon dioxide fixation with reductions in the duration of the light period was evident, with the exception of the 12:12 (night:day) cycles. Reductions of up to 99.69\% in the carbon-fixation rates as compared with cultures under continuous illumination were obtained.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a semi-empirical calculation of the air-broadened half-widths and the air pressure-induced frequency shifts for the H216O isotopologue. This semi-empirical calculation is based on fits of several recent high-quality measurements and theoretical calculations to the first-order terms in the expansion of the complex Robert--Bonamy (CRB) equations, which yields a second- and first-order polynomial function of the differences in the upper- and lower-state vibrational quantum numbers for the half-width and line shift, respectively. The aim of this work was to obtain a complete set of air-broadened half-widths and air pressure-induced frequency shifts for transitions of H216O present in the HITRAN database from microwave to the visible in order to supplement the observed and calculated values. For around 700 sets of rotational quantum numbers (J{$\prime$}Ka{$\prime$}Kc{$\prime\leftarrow$}J{${''}$}Ka{${''}$}Kc{${''}$}), semi-empirical coefficients describing the vibrational dependence of the air-broadened half-widths and the air pressure-induced frequency shifts have been obtained directly from the fit of experimental and/or theoretical data. The accuracy of the parameters deduced from this calculation is estimated to be between 5\% and 10\% for the air-broadened half-widths and between 0.001 and 0.01cm-1atm-1 for the air pressure-induced frequency shifts. For sets of rotational quantum numbers for which either none or insufficient experimental/theoretical data were available to deduce a vibrational dependence, further approximations have been used to obtain a complete set of semi-empirical coefficients.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectrophotometry, a standard tool for quantitative analysis, suffers from two major drawbacks: lack of sensitivity and vulnerability to scattering. It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

As such, it is fundamental to understand the physiological mechanisms and associated molecular basis of their endurance during the long polar night. Here, using the polar diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus, we report an integrative analysis combining transcriptomic, microscopic and biochemical approaches to shed light on the strategies used to survive the polar night. We reveal that in prolonged darkness, diatom cells enter a state of quiescence with reduced metabolic and transcriptional activity, during which no cell division occurs. We propose that minimal energy is provided by respiration and degradation of protein, carbohydrate and lipid stores and that homeostasis is maintained by autophagy in prolonged darkness. We also report internal structural changes that manifest the morphological acclimation of cells to darkness, including the appearance of a large vacuole. Our results further show that immediately following a return to light, diatom cells are able to use photoprotective mechanisms and rapidly resume photosynthesis, demonstrating the remarkable robustness of polar diatoms to prolonged darkness at low temperature.},

Ocean models predict declines of 1 to 7\% in the global ocean O2 inventory over the next century, with declines continuing for a thousand years or more into the future. An important consequence may be an expansion in the area and volume of so-called oxygen minimum zones, where O2 levels are too low to support many macrofauna and profound changes in biogeochemical cycling occur. Significant deoxygenation has occurred over the past 50 years in the North Pacific and tropical oceans, suggesting larger changes are looming. The potential for larger O2 declines in the future suggests the need for an improved observing system for tracking ocean O2 changes.},

  abstract = {Many photosynthetic organisms can acclimate to the quantity and quality of light present in their environment. In certain cyanobacteria the wavelengths of light in the environment control the synthesis of specific polypeptides of light harvesting antenna complex or phycobilisome. This phenomenon, called complementary chromatic adaptation, is most dramatically observed in comparison of cyanobacteria after growth in green light and red light. In red light-grown cells the phycobilisome is largely composed of phycocyanin and its associated linker polypeptides (the latter are important for the assembly of the phycocyanin subunits and their placement within the light harvesting structure); the organisms appear blue-green color. In green light-grown cells the phycobilisome is largely composed of phycoerythrin and its associated linker polypeptides; the organisms appear red in color. The ways in which these cyanobacteria sense their changing light environment and the regulatory elements involved in controlling the process of complementary chromatic adaptation are discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {Complementary chromatic adaptation appears to be controlled by a complex regulatory system with similarity to four-step phosphorelays. Such pathways utilize two histidine and two aspartate residues for signal transduction. Previous studies of the signaling system controlling complementary chromatic adaptation have uncovered two elements of this pathway, a putative sensor, RcaE, and a response regulator, RcaC. In this work, we describe a second response regulator controlling complementary chromatic adaptation, RcaF, and identify putative DNA binding and histidine phosphoacceptor domains within RcaC. RcaF is a small response regulator with similarity to SpoOF of Bacillus subtilis; the latter functions in the four-step phosphorelay system controlling sporulation. We have also determined that within this phosphorelay pathway, RcaE precedes RcaF, and RcaC is probably downstream of RcaE and RcaF. This signal transduction pathway is novel because it appears to use at least five, instead of four, phosphoacceptor domains in the phosphorelay circuit.}

During CCA, cyanobacterial cells change from brick red to bright blue green, depending on their light color environment. The apparent simplicity of this spectacular, photoreversible event belies the complexity of the cellular response to changes in light color. Recent results have shown that the regulation of CCA is also complex and involves at least three pathways. One is controlled by a phytochrome-class photoreceptor that is responsive to green and red light and a complex two-component signal transduction pathway, whereas another is based on sensing redox state. Studies of CCA are uncovering the strategies used by photosynthetic organisms during light acclimation and the means by which they regulate these responses.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic phenotyping requires quick characterization of dynamic traits when measuring large plant numbers in a fluctuating environment. Here, we evaluated the light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) method for its capacity to yield rapidly fluorometric parameters from 0.6~m distance. The close approximation of LIFT to conventional chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) parameters is shown under controlled conditions in spinach leaves and isolated thylakoids when electron transport was impaired by anoxic conditions or chemical inhibitors. The ChlF rise from minimum fluorescence (Fo) to maximum fluorescence induced by fast repetition rate (Fm-FRR) flashes was dominated by reduction of the primary electron acceptor in photosystem II (QA). The subsequent reoxidation of QA- was quantified using the relaxation of ChlF in 0.65~ms (Fr1) and 120~ms (Fr2) phases. Reoxidation efficiency of QA- (Fr1/Fv, where Fv~=~Fm-FRR\,-\,Fo) decreased when electron transport was impaired, while quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) showed often no significant effect. ChlF relaxations of the LIFT were similar to an independent other method. Under increasing light intensities, Fr2{$\prime$}/Fq{$\prime$} (where Fr2{$\prime$} and Fq{$\prime$} represent Fr2 and Fv in the light-adapted state, respectively) was hardly affected, whereas the operating efficiency of photosystem II (Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) decreased due to non-photochemical quenching. Fm-FRR was significantly lower than the ChlF maximum induced by multiple turnover (Fm-MT) flashes. However, the resulting Fv/Fm and Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} from both flashes were highly correlated. The LIFT method complements Fv/Fm with information about efficiency of electron transport. Measurements in situ and from a distance facilitate application in high-throughput and automated phenotyping.},

  abstract = {CO2 storage in the oceans is strongly affected by biological processes. Production of organic matter through phytoplankton photosynthesis drives CO2 sequestration, which feeds back to atmospheric CO2 and global climate. The ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 and temperature is strongly associated with changes in ocean chemistry and increasing seawater temperatures. To investigate these impacts on coastal phytoplankton under conditions predicted for the year 2100 (pCO2 elevated to 800 {\textmu}atm and +4 {$^\circ$}C temperature), three factorial experiments were conducted with natural communities sampled from the western English Channel (WEC). Elevated pCO2 increased phytoplankton biomass by up to 20-fold while elevated temperature resulted in an increase of up to 14-fold. Light-saturated photosynthetic carbon fixation rates increased {$>$} 6-fold under elevated pCO2 while an increase of up to 3-fold resulted from elevated temperature. The combined effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature reduced biomass in late summer and had no effects on biomass in the autumn with no significant effects on photosynthetic carbon fixation rates in either season. Individual treatments of elevated pCO2 and temperature resulted in near mono-specific communities: diatoms in late summer and nanophytoplankton in autumn. Combined effects of both factors resulted in the most diverse phytoplankton communities and promoted increased dinoflagellate and Synechococcus biomass at the expense of diatoms and nanophytoplankton. Elevated pCO2 alone promoted dominance of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, Phaeocystis in spring and autumn, while the combination of elevated pCO2 and temperature promoted biomass of the HAB species, Prorocentrum minimum in autumn. The results indicate that experimental simulations of year 2100 pCO2 and temperature may significantly modify phytoplankton community structure with a positive feedback on atmospheric CO2 in late summer and no change on feedback in autumn. In either scenario, no increase in phytoplankton productivity during a period of changes in bulk carbonate chemistry resulting from ongoing anthropogenic carbon uptake, may be expected to negatively influence carbon biogeochemistry in the WEC.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms tightly regulate the energy arriving to the reaction centers in order to avoid photodamage or imbalance between the photosystems. To this purpose, cyanobacteria have developed mechanisms involving relatively rapid (seconds to minutes) changes in the photosynthetic apparatus. In this review, two of these processes will be described: orange carotenoid protein(OCP)-related photoprotection and state transitions which optimize energy distribution between the two photosystems. The photoactive OCP is a light intensity sensor and an energy dissipater. Photoactivation depends on light intensity and only the red-active OCP form, by interacting with phycobilisome cores, increases thermal energy dissipation at the level of the antenna. A second protein, the ``fluorescence recovery protein'', is needed to recover full antenna capacity under low light conditions. This protein accelerates OCP conversion to the inactive orange form and plays a role in dislodging the red OCP protein from the phycobilisome. The mechanism of state transitions is still controversial. Changes in the redox state of the plastoquinone pool induce movement of phycobilisomes and/or photosystems leading to redistribution of energy absorbed by phycobilisomes between PSII and PSI and/or to changes in excitation energy spillover between photosystems. The different steps going from the induction of redox changes to movement of phycobilisomes or photosystems remain to be elucidated.},

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses (`flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 {$\mu$}s to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption cross-section decreased by about 40\%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of {$\sigma$}PS II, p, and the kinetics of Q-A reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energy-conversion.},

  abstract = {Cell division of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and other phytoplankton typically becomes entrained to diel light/dark cycles under laboratory conditions, with division occurring primarily during dark phases and production occurring during light phases. Under these conditions, increases in cell and biomass concentrations deviate from exponential functions on time scales {$<$} 24 h. These deviations lead to significant diel variations in common measurements of phytoplankton physiology such as cellular quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon (POC, PIC) and their production rates. Being time-dependent, only the temporal mean of the various values during the day are comparable between experiments. Deviations from exponential growth furthermore imply that increases in cell and biomass concentrations cannot be expressed by the daily growth rate {$\mu$}24 h (typically determined from daily increments in cell concentrations). Consequently, conventional calculations of production as the product of a cellular quota (e.g., POC quota) and {$\mu$}24 h are mathematically incorrect. To account for this, we here describe short-term changes in cell and biomass concentrations of fast-dividing, dilute-batch cultures of E. huxleyi grown under a diel light/dark cycle using linear regression. Based on the derived models, we present calculations for daily means of cellular quotas and production rates. Conventional (time-specific) measurements of cellular quotas and production differ from daily means by up to 65\% in our example and, under some circumstances, cause false ``effects'' of treatments. Intending to reduce errors in ecophysiological studies, we recommend determining daily means---mathematically or by adjusting the experimental setup or sampling times appropriately.},

  abstract = {We describe a computer model that simulates diurnal changes in buoyancy and vertical migration by planktonic cyanobacteria in lakes. The model is based on new measurements of the rates of buoyant density change by cyanobacteria in laboratory cultures. The overall rate of density change was found to be the result of two simultaneous processes: (i) a light-dependent increase in density, supported by photosynthesis; and (ii) a time-dependent decrease related to the previous light history. Using the experimentally determined rate constants of these processes, the computer model calculated how buoyant density changes of a colony, responding to the irradiance at a given depth and time of day, would affect its sinking or floating velocity. The model makes a number of interesting predictions on vertical migration, (i) Colony size affects the speed but not the depth range of vertical migrations, (ii) An increase in the proportion of cell volume in a colony has a similar effect to that of colony size, (iii) Surface blooms can be dynamic, with colonies floating up replacing colonies sinking out of the surface bloom, (iv) Phosphorus-limited colonies are likely to migrate to greater depths than light-limited colonies, enabling them to exploit the nutrient-rich depths. The vertical migration of a well-documented natural population is simulated. The model gives a good description of the buoyancy behaviour of the cyanobacterium in the lake. Other simulations explain why colony-forming cells cannot form a stratified layer, while single filaments can. The ecological implications of colony formation are discussed.}

  abstract = {The effect of different photoperiods: 24~h illumination and a 12:12-h light/dark (12L:12D) cycle on the growth rate and biomass productivity was studied in five algal species: Neochloris~conjuncta, Neochloris~terrestris, Neochloris~texensis, Botryococcus~braunii and Scenedesmus obliquus. The green microalgae examined differ in the reproduction mode. Continuous illumination stimulated the growth of B.~braunii and S.~obliquus more effectively than the growth of the microalgal species from the genus Neochloris. However, under shorter duration of light of the same intensity (12L:12D cycle), the growth of all the three species of Neochloris was stimulated. Under continuous illumination, the specific growth rate in the first phase of B.~braunii and S.~obliquus cultures was higher than the growth rate of Neochloris, whereas under the 12L:12D cycle, the specific growth rate of all the three Neochloris species was generally higher than that in B.~braunii and S.~obliquus. As a result, the light regime influenced algal biomass productivity differently. The maximum biomass productivity was obtained in B. braunii and S. obliquus cultures carried out at continuous illumination. All the Neochloris species produced biomass more efficiently at the 12L:12D cycle, which was two--threefold higher than that of B. braunii and S. obliquus. The unicellular species of the green microalgae from the genus Neochloris, examined for the first time in this study, are promising prospective objects for algal biotechnology.},

  abstract = {The pelagic sunlit zone or euphotic zone is defined as the lit surface of the ocean down to a depth where enough light penetrates to allow photosynthesis. Typically, the depth at which photosynthesis still exceeds respiration coincides with the depth at which the light intensity is attenuated to 1\% of the sea surface irradiance. The composition of the light-dependent pelagic microbiome is both a function of light availability and spectral quality, as well as the strength of the water column stratification relative to turbulent mixing. Solar radiation provides the energy source for the pelagic light-dependent microbiome. However, additional environmental factors affecting the surface layer of the ocean make this environment spatially and temporally variable. Latitude has a combined effect on photoperiod, seasonal light levels, and temperature regimes. Overall, the microbiome inhabiting the euphotic zone in the ocean is adapted to steep gradients in light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations that can occur on local spatial scales. The three main categories of microorganisms that conserve energy from sunlight are the cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae who carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, the aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (AAnPB) that perform photoheterotrophy, and proteorhodopsin-containing bacteria which synthesize ATP via a light-driven proton pump. Organisms within all three groups are taxonomically diverse and are adapted to cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions. Although the energy flow through the euphotic zone is controlled by primary producers that carry out carbon fixation via oxygenic photosynthesis, the microbiome in this layer of the ocean is additionally composed of heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and symbiotic microorganisms who interact with primary producers either in a predatory role or as nutrient recyclers.},

The presence and arrangement of these gene clusters give picocyanobacteria characteristic light absorption properties and allow the colonization of specific ecological niches. To date, a full understanding of the evolution and distribution of the PBS gene cluster in picocyanobacteria has been hampered by the scarcity of genome sequences from fresh- and brackish water-adapted strains. To remediate this, we analysed genomes assembled from metagenomic samples collected along a natural salinity gradient, and over the course of a growth season, in the Baltic Sea. We found that while PBS gene clusters in picocyanobacteria sampled in marine habitats were highly similar to known references, brackish-adapted genotypes harboured a novel type not seen in previously sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the novel gene cluster belonged to a clade of uncultivated picocyanobacteria that dominate the brackish Baltic Sea throughout the summer season, but are uncommon in other examined aquatic ecosystems. Further, our data suggest that the PE genes were lost in the ancestor of PC-containing coastal picocyanobacteria and that multiple horizontal gene transfer events have re-introduced PE genes into brackish-adapted strains, including the novel clade discovered here.}

The complete list of original Baltic strains and strains acquired from other collections, which are maintained in CCBA, will appear on the web site: http://www.ocean.univ.gda.pl/ {\textasciitilde}ccba/. At present there is no significant algal culture collection in Poland. Therefore, an en- richment of CCBA with new algal strains isolated from different inland waters in Poland is planned. Special attention would be paid to algal species threatened by extinction, rare, en- demic, toxic, harmful or typical of our region. The growth of Baltic strains has been characterized by factorial experiment approach. The effects of salinity, light and temperature, as well as their interaction have been deter- mined. The brackishwater character showed: Chlorella vulgaris, Oocystis submarina, O. parva, Stichococcus bacillaris, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Skeletonema costatum, and Nodularia spumigena, cyanobacterium Phormidium amphibium was the marine strain and green algae from the genus Scenedesmus and Monoraphidium were freshwater strains. The growth of the above strains was strongly affected by light and temperature interaction. This effect was especially distinct in diatoms. However, the influence on the light alone was not so well-marked. For six strains: Monoraphidium convolutum, Amphora coffeaeformis, Entomoneis punctulata, Haslea spicula, Nitzschia thermaloides and the second strain of Skeletonema costatum only influence of salinity was investigated. It occurred that green alga was a typ- ically freshwater species, Skeletonema costatum showed marine character, however the re- maining strains were brackishwater.}

  abstract = {Marine phytoplankton is an essential contributor to global primary production (PP). Conventional methods to measure PP are time-consuming and the results are usually influenced by bottle effect. Radio isotope tracking methods using radioactive labels are very expensive and limited by health/safety regulations. Measuring PP through variable chlorophyll a (Chla) fluorescence based techniques is a potential cheaper, handier and safer choice. Especially its much higher temporal resolution is quite attractive. However, the regulation of the conversion factor -- the electron requirement for carbon fixation ({\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C) -- from photosynthetically produced electrons to carbon based PP, is still not fully understood, especially under fluctuating conditions which are typical in natural environments. We investigated the robustness of {\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C and the contributions of the xanthophyll cycle and alternative sinks of electron to {\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C during transient phases, through Dunaliella tertiolecta culture experiments in which the phosphorus supply was varied. Besides, we also investigated whether the theory developed to obtain absolute rates of ETRPSII by Oxborough et al. 2012 and Silsbe et al. 2015 holds under such transient phase. Our results revealed that: 1) {\cyrchar\CYRF}e,C doesn't remain stable and could increase 3-fold from a P-replete condition to a P-limited environment. 2) The roles of the xanthophyll cycle in NPQ is limited, but cyclic electron flow around PSII (or PSI) by PTOX can contribute about 50\% to electrons sink and it decreased a lot when transformed into P-limited environment. 3) The assumption used for derivations of [RCII] from sigma algorithm and optical absorption coefficient of PSII (aLHII) for the new absorption algorithm, that KR is constant, proposed by Oxborough et al. 2012 doesn't hold during fluctuating environment with different P concentrations, and the KR values we got were quite higher than the default value. Our finding points to the limitations of ETRPSII derivations, and provides more information on the conversion of photosynthetically produced electrons to carbon-based PP. More studies are required before the wide spread of Chla fluorescence in measuring primary production.},

  abstract = {As the physical environment of the Arctic Ocean shifts seasonally from ice-covered to open water, the limiting resource for phytoplankton growth shifts from light to nutrients. To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low-light, high-nutrient, ice-covered spring and the high-light, low-nutrient, ice-free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become ``primed'' for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.},

T. pseudonana showed fastest growth rates under long photoperiods and low to moderate light intensities, while the larger T. punctigera showed fastest growth rates under short photoperiods and higher light intensities. Photosystem II function and content responded primarily to instantaneous growth light intensities during the photoperiod, while diel carbon fixation and RUBISCO content responded more to photoperiod duration than to instantaneous light intensity. Changing photoperiods caused species-specific changes in the responses of photochemical yield (e-/photon) to growth light intensity. These photophysiological variables showed complex responses to photoperiod and to growth light intensity. Growth rate also showed complex responses to photoperiod and growth light intensity. But these complex responses resolved into a close relation between growth rate and the cumulative daily generation of reductant, across the matrix of photoperiods and light intensities.},

We investigated the influences of diluted seawater on the vegetative growth and reproductive cell formation of the alga. The thalli that were cultivated under low salinities (10‰ and 20‰) and low pH values (pH around 7.0) showed obvious and steady biomass gain, while those cultivated under high salinities (40‰) and relatively higher pH conditions (pH around 8.0) manifested significant biomass loss. The trend was, however, completely the opposite for reproductive cell formation and there were indications that enrichment, over very wide concentration ranges of both nitrogen and phosphate, could significantly promote vegetative growth. Results also indicated that relatively low salinity and low pH regimes boosted vegetative growth but were unfavorable for reproductive cell formation and vice versa. Based on these results, the possible origin and development mechanisms of the green tide event are discussed. Eutrophication in the Changjiang River estuary and adjacent sea areas, as well as extremely high freshwater inflows before, and during, the flood of 2007 -- due to the full operation of large-scale water facilities in the area -- may have both played an important role in the formation and development of the green tide event.},

Additionally, the partial purified C-PC displayed 89\% antioxidant activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) and 11\% of superoxide free radical scavenging activity, respectively. The production of C-PC from PCC7002 reduced the CO2 emission and exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and lead ion adsorption at room temperature, which has the great potential for eco-friendly application.},

Here, we assessed the effects of N and Fe amendments on both photosynthesis and biomass of phytoplankton (including final chlorophyll a biomass and taxonomic composition) in that region. Overall, the carrying capacity of phytoplankton biomass was primarily constrained by N, and Fe was a limiting resource only near the equator where phytoplankton was co-limited by N and Fe. Positive growth responses in nutrient-receiving treatments were predominantly caused by diatoms, sometimes together with Synechococcus. The often strong stimulation of large phytoplankton in these treatments substantially modified the phytoplankton assemblage from picoplankton- to diatom-dominated, which was often accompanied by a significant increase in photosynthetic competence. This is the first report showing that phytoplankton in the tropical western North Pacific are primarily limited by N, and co-limited by Fe in some areas. We combined our results with those from comparable studies in the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean to propose a general typology that describes and predicts the long-term effects of rate-limiting N and Fe on phytoplankton final biomass and changes in community structure.}

We report fundamental differences in size distributions of marine and freshwater diatoms, with marine diatoms significantly larger than freshwater species. An evolutionary game theoretical model with empirical allometries of growth and nutrient uptake shows that these differences can be explained by nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation, nutrient fluctuations and mixed layer depth differences. Constant and pulsed phosphorus supply select for small sizes, as does constant nitrogen supply. In contrast, intermediate frequency nitrogen pulses common in the ocean select for large sizes or the evolutionarily stable coexistence of large and small sizes. Size-dependent sinking interacts with mixed layer depth (MLD) to further modulate optimal sizes, with smaller sizes selected for by strong sinking and shallow MLD. In freshwaters, widespread phosphorus limitation, together with strong sinking and shallow MLD produce size distributions with smaller range, means and upper values, compared with the ocean. Shifting patterns of nutrient limitation and mixing may alter diatom size distributions, affecting global carbon cycle and the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.}

  abstract = {We performed a series of experiments with Antarctic natural phytoplankton communities exposed to natural levels of solar radiation in order to quantify the effect of ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on phytoplankton growth, cell death and their balance. Treatments in which UVR was excluded showed a high increase in biomass, dominated by diatoms, with chl a (chlorophyll a) reaching values as high as 22 {\textmu}g l--1, 9 times larger than initial values. In contrast, chl a values remained low at the end of the experiments under treatments with full solar radiation. Phytoplankton growth rates were also inhibited by UVR, increasing up to 5 times in UVR-excluded treatments. The percentage of dead cells within Antarctic phytoplankton communities decreased in treatments with UVR blocked. The Antarctic phytoplankton populations studied appeared to be strongly controlled by UV at surface irradiances with biomasses inhibited by up to 80--90\%. This suggests that increased UVR levels over Antarctica may reduce phytoplankton growth rates and cause cell death, thus reducing the phytoplankton stock. These effects may have important consequences for the food web in Antarctic waters.},

Underwater oceanic levels of UVR and visible light can induce significant cell death in picophytoplankton communities. The decay rates of living cells induced by solar radiation was highest for Prochlorococcus sp., which showed an average decay rate of -0.24 {\textpm} 0.053 h-1 (mean {\textpm} SE) in the experiments, whereas Synechococcus sp. showed the lowest decay rate of -0.021 {\textpm} 0.008 h-1 (mean {\textpm} SE) in treatments ranging from the full incident irradiance to 23\% of the irradiance incident below the ocean surface. Decay rates decreased significantly upon removal of UVR, demonstrating a major effect of UVR on cell death, although ambient levels of visible light alone still induced cell death in Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotic populations, but not in Synechococcus sp. The high cell death of Prochlorococcus induced by total solar radiation resulted in short halflife values for this genus, ranging between 1.5 and 13.4 h across treatments. The half-life times for Synechococcus sp. and eukaryotic picoplankton cells exposed to UVR were longer, varying from 8.8 to 14.7 h and from 2.1 to 31.7 h, respectively. The UVR doses required to reduce the picophytoplankton populations by 50\% (LRD50) differed among the three groups, with considerably lower doses required for Prochlorococcus sp. Prochlorococcus sp. is highly sensitive to solar radiation, contrasting with the higher tolerance of Synechococcus sp. High, but taxonspecific, phytoplankton mortality induced by ambient UVR levels may act as a primary driver of the community structure of autotrophs and affect the dynamics of the microbial food web in clear, oligotrophic, oceanic waters.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton play a pivotal role in global biogeochemical and trophic processes and provide essential ecosystem services. However, there is still no broad consensus on how and to what extent their community composition responds to environmental variability. Here, high-frequency oceanographic and biological data collected over more than 25~years in a coastal Mediterranean site are used to shed light on the temporal patterns of phytoplankton species and assemblages in their environmental context. Because of the proximity to the coast and due to large-scale variations, environmental conditions showed variability on the short and long-term scales. Nonetheless, an impressive regularity characterised the annual occurrence of phytoplankton species and their assemblages, which translated into their remarkable stability over decades. Photoperiod was the dominant factor related to community turnover and replacement, which points at a possible endogenous regulation of biological processes associated with species-specific phenological patterns, in analogy with terrestrial plants. These results highlight the considerable stability and resistance of phytoplankton communities in response to different environmental pressures, which contrast the view of these organisms as passively undergoing changes that occur at different temporal scales in their habitat, and show how, under certain conditions, biological processes may prevail over environmental forcing.},

Here, we study the effect of blue (450~nm), orange (625~nm), and red (660~nm) light on growth of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana and other cyanobacteria containing phycocyanin or phycoerythrin. Our results demonstrate that specific growth rates of the cyanobacteria were similar in orange and red light, but much lower in blue light. Conversely, specific growth rates of the green alga C. sorokiniana were similar in blue and red light, but lower in orange light. Oxygen production rates of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were five-fold lower in blue than in orange and red light at low light intensities but approached the same saturation level in all three colors at high light intensities. Measurements of 77~K fluorescence emission demonstrated a lower ratio of photosystem I to photosystem II (PSI:PSII ratio) and relatively more phycobilisomes associated with PSII (state 1) in blue light than in orange and red light. These results support the hypothesis that blue light, which is not absorbed by phycobilisomes, creates an imbalance between the two photosystems of cyanobacteria with an energy excess at PSI and a deficiency at the PSII-side of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Our results help to explain why phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria use blue light less efficiently than species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae such as Prochlorococcus, green algae and~terrestrial plants.},

  abstract = {In this study, we develop a mechanistic understanding of how temperature affects growth and photosynthesis in 10 geographically and physiologically diverse strains of Synechococcus spp. We found that Synechococcus spp. are able to regulate photochemistry over a range of temperatures by using state transitions and altering the abundance of photosynthetic proteins. These strategies minimize photosystem II (PSII) photodamage by keeping the photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC), and hence PSII reaction centers, more oxidized. At temperatures that approach the optimal growth temperature of each strain when cellular demand for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is greatest, the phycobilisome (PBS) antenna associates with PSII, increasing the flux of electrons into the ETC. By contrast, under low temperature, when slow growth lowers the demand for NADPH and linear ETC declines, the PBS associates with photosystem I. This favors oxidation of PSII and potential increase in cyclic electron flow. For Synechococcus sp. WH8102, growth at higher temperatures led to an increase in the abundance of PBS pigment proteins, as well as higher abundance of subunits of the PSII, photosystem I, and cytochrome b6f complexes. This would allow cells to increase photosynthetic electron flux to meet the metabolic requirement for NADPH during rapid growth. These PBS-based temperature acclimation strategies may underlie the larger geographic range of this group relative to Prochlorococcus spp., which lack a PBS.}

These light responses are linked to phylogeny and pigmentation. Marine sub-cluster 5.1A isolates with higher phycouribilin: phycoerythrobilin ratios fell toward the LLO end of the continuum, while sub-cluster 5.1B, 5.2 and estuarine Synechococcus with less phycouribilin fell toward the HLO end of the continuum. Global proteomes were highly responsive to light, with {$>$} 50\% of abundant proteins varying more than twofold between the lowest and highest irradiance. All strains downregulated phycobilisome proteins with increasing irradiance. Regulation of proteins involved in photosynthetic electron transport, carbon fixation, oxidative stress protection (superoxide dismutases) and iron and nitrogen metabolism varied among strains, as did the number of high light inducible protein (Hlip) and DNA photolyase genes in their genomes. All but one LLO strain possessed the photoprotective orange carotenoid protein (OCP). The unique combinations of light responses in each strain gives rise to distinct photophysiological phenotypes that may affect Synechococcus distributions in the ocean.},

In Calothrix PCC 7601, modulation of the polypeptide composition of the phycobi1isomes occurs in response to changes of the light wavelength, a phenomenon known as complementary chromatic adaptation. Under green illumination, cells synthesize phycoerythrin and its two specifically associated linker polypeptides (L 35R and L 36R ), while under red illumination none of these proteins are detected. Using specific probes, a single transcript (1450 nucleotide long) corresponding to the cpe genes was detected but only in green-light-grown cells, establishing the occurrence of transcriptional regulation for the expression of this operon in response to light wavelength changes. The size of this transcript excludes the possibility that the phycoerythrin-associated L 35R and L 36R could be cotranscribed with the cpeA and cpeB genes.}

Although they require solar energy for photosynthesis, excess light and associated high UV radiations can induce high levels of oxidative stress that may have deleterious effects on their growth and productivity. Here, we compared the photophysiologies of the model strains Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803 grown under a bell-shaped light/dark cycle of high visible light supplemented or not with UV. Prochlorococcus exhibited a higher sensitivity to photoinactivation than Synechococcus under both conditions, as shown by a larger drop of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield at noon and different diel patterns of the D1 protein pool. In the presence of UV, the PSII repair rate was significantly depressed at noon in Prochlorococcus compared to Synechococcus. Additionally, Prochlorococcus was more sensitive than Synechococcus to oxidative stress, as shown by the different degrees of PSII photoinactivation after addition of hydrogen peroxide. A transcriptional analysis also revealed dramatic discrepancies between the two organisms in the diel expression patterns of several genes involved notably in the biosynthesis and/or repair of photosystems, light-harvesting complexes, CO2 fixation as well as protection mechanisms against light, UV, and oxidative stress, which likely translate profound differences in their light-controlled regulation. Altogether our results suggest that while Synechococcus has developed efficient ways to cope with light and UV stress, Prochlorococcus cells seemingly survive stressful hours of the day by launching a minimal set of protection mechanisms and by temporarily bringing down several key metabolic processes. This study provides unprecedented insights into understanding the distinct depth distributions and dynamics of these two picocyanobacteria in the field.},

In a first step, a biogeochemical three-dimensional model was developed to simulate growth and erosion---transport---deposition of free-floating ulvae; this model was able to converge on a realistic distribution of               Ulva               deposits after a few months, even though it was initialized with a strongly unrealistic distribution of settled ulvae. In a second step, and unfortunately for recovery plans, the tracking technique, applied in this model to all the nitrogen sources entering the bay, revealed that the small, nitrate-polluted rivers flowing directly into the eutrophicated area had a negligible effect, whereas more distant but stronger sources, a big river and a big urban sewage plant, even after dilution, accounted for about 50\% and 20\%, respectively, of the algal nitrogen content during summer. Despite its high N flux, open ocean contributes only 15\% to               Ulva               growth. The suppression of only one of the main nitrogen sources would not significantly decrease the               Ulva               bloom, because of the high nitrogen surplus present in the site. The remaining sources would still saturate the needs of the maximum               Ulva               biomass the site is able to produce. The tracking technique, however, shows that the N turnover in               Ulva               is only 4 months. Thus, improvements would occur within a year following large N reductions.},

  abstract = {The ability of phototrophs to colonise different environments relies on robust protection against oxidative stress, a critical requirement for the successful evolutionary transition from water to land. Photosynthetic organisms have developed numerous strategies to adapt their photosynthetic apparatus to changing light conditions in order to optimise their photosynthetic yield, which is crucial for life on Earth to exist. Photosynthetic acclimation is an excellent example of the complexity of biological systems, where highly diverse processes, ranging from electron excitation over protein protonation to enzymatic processes coupling ion gradients with biosynthetic activity, interact on drastically different timescales from picoseconds to hours. Efficient functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus and its protection is paramount for efficient downstream processes, including metabolism and growth. Modern experimental techniques can be successfully integrated with theoretical and mathematical models to promote our understanding of underlying mechanisms and principles. This review aims to provide a retrospective analysis of multidisciplinary photosynthetic acclimation research carried out by members of the Marie Curie Initial Training Project, AccliPhot, placing the results in a wider context. The review also highlights the applicability of photosynthetic organisms for industry, particularly with regards to the cultivation of microalgae. It intends to demonstrate how theoretical concepts can successfully complement experimental studies broadening our knowledge of common principles in acclimation processes in photosynthetic organisms, as well as in the field of applied microalgal biotechnology.}

In the Atlantic Ocean, these 2 picoplankters exhibit different spatial and seasonal distributions. In order to better understand the ecology of these species, we measured growth and photoacclimation responses including fluorescence excitation [F*ph({$\lambda$})] and in vivo absorption [a*ph({$\lambda$})] spectra over a range of growth irradiances for P. marinus (clone SS120) and Synechococcus WH8103, both isolated from the Sargasso Sea. To explore the physiological diversity of P. marinus, we measured the physiological responses of another P. marinus clone, MED4, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate as a function of temperature was also examined for all 3 clones. P. marinus SS120 and Synechococcus WH8103 have different temperature optima for growth, but these do not explain the different latitudinal distributions in the North Atlantic. P. marinus SSI20 is adapted for growth at low light intensities relative to Synechococcus WH8103, which is consistent with the relative depth distribution of P. marinus and Synechococcus in the field. The light-dependent growth response of P. marinus MED4 is more similar to Synechococcus WH8103 than to P. marinus SS120. The unique pigment content of P. marinus (which contain divinyl chlorophylls a and b) results in maximal absorbance in the blue wavelengths. The high total chl b/chl a ratio of P. marinus SS120 enables it to absorb more light, grow faster than Synechococcus WH8103 (and P. marinus MED4) at low light intensities, and presumably to outcompete Synechococcus in the deep euphotic zone. At high growth irradiances, P. marinus SS120 contains measureable amounts of normal (monovinyl) chl b, whereas this pigment was not found in P. marinus MED4 at any growth irradiance. Photoacclimative changes in pigment ratios, and not package effect, account for most of the changes in a*ph({$\lambda$}) and F*ph({$\lambda$}) with light intensity for all 3 picoplankters. At high light intensities, zeaxanthin contributes substantially to a*ph({$\lambda$}) in the blue, but appears to transfer little or no excitation energy to the reaction centers, based on F*ph({$\lambda$}) measurements. For P. marinus, high absorption in the blue due to divinyl chl a and b relative to normal chl a and b, absorption due to zeaxanthin, and small cell size result in unusually high a*ph (blue) relative to a*ph (red).}

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms regulate their responses to many diverse stimuli in an effort to balance light harvesting with utilizable light energy for carbon fixation and growth (source--sink regulation). This balance is critical to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species that can lead to cell death. However, investigating the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria using ensemble-based measurements remains a challenge due to population heterogeneity. Here, to address this problem, we used long-term quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modelling and genetic manipulation to visualize and analyse the growth and subcellular dynamics of individual wild-type and mutant cyanobacterial cells over multiple generations. We reveal that mechanical confinement of actively growing Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 cells leads to the physical disassociation of phycobilisomes and energetic decoupling from the photosynthetic reaction centres. We suggest that the mechanical regulation of photosynthesis is a critical failsafe that prevents cell expansion when light and nutrients are plentiful, but when space is limiting. These results imply that cyanobacteria must convert a fraction of the available light energy into mechanical energy to overcome frictional forces in the environment, providing insight into the regulation of photosynthesis and how microorganisms navigate their physical environment.},

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({\textpm}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

Chlorophyll-specific and carbon-specific absorption coefficients of the algae were monitored, allowing changes in the quantum yield for growth ({$\Phi$}{\textmu}) to be assessed. All the parameters appear to be practically unaffected by chromatic conditions, provided that the photosynthetically usable radiation (PUR) is made equal. Diatoms respond to the energy level whatever the color. Nevertheless, due to opposite influences of the modifications in the ``package'' effect and in the C : Chl a ratio ({$\Theta$}), the light-harvesting capabilities of the living carbon pool vary only weakly. Therefore the growth rate change (from 0.3 to 1.2 d-1) is essentially governed by the change in {$\Phi$}{\textmu} (from 0.01 to 0.052 mol C retained mol-1 quanta absorbed). The kinetics of the Chl-a-per-cell modification and of the {$\Phi$}{\textmu} response is rather fast (within approximately one generation). Quantum yield for growth is halved after a transfer to high irradiance; thereafter it remains low and steady. Conversely the enhanced value observed just after transfer to low irradiance is not maintained beyond 2 or 3 d; after that, {$\Phi$}{\textmu} is restored practically to its initial value.},

  abstract = {Recent studies by Morel (1978) and Platt, Sathyendranath, Caverhill and Lewis (1988) have demonstrated the relative stability of the relationship between available photosynthetic energy at the ocean surface and energy stored by algal photosynthesis, once it has been normalized with respect to the column integrated chlorophyll biomass. Therefore the cross section via a vis photosynthesis and per unit of areal chlorophyll, {$\psi\ast$}, in m2 (g Chl)-1, should be relatively stable in spite of the various environmental and trophic situations possibly encountered in the open ocean. Such an ecological or biogeochemical ``constant'' is of importance when trying to transform biomass maps (obtained from remotely sensed ocean colour data) into primary production maps. Its approximate constancy has to be understood and deserves analysis. This analysis rests on the use of the local and instantaneous growth rate equation (Kiefer and Mitchell, 1983) which has to be triply integrated with respect to wavelength, depth and time. Such an integration is, in effect, the core of a light production model which schematically includes the following steps: 1.(i) to compute as a function of the sun elevation for various days, latitudes and atmospheric conditions (aerosols, water vapour, etc.) the photosynthetic energy impinging at the ocean surface (direct and diffuse components);2.(ii) to account for the loss by reflection at the air-sea interface;3.(iii) to propagate this radiant energy (in terms of spectral scalar irradiance) throughout the water column and according to given pigment vertical profiles;4.(iv) to evaluate what part of energy is absorbed by algae within the productive column;5.(v) and finally to compute that part of absorbed energy which is stored in the form of organic carbon added to the initial biomass; this last step implies that the yield for growth be modelled as a function of the irradiance level and temperature. Sensitivity tests have been effected with respect not only to the physical parameters which can be accurately modelled, but also with respect to the physiological factors for which values and parameterisation are more uncertain. Non-linear and interactive influences cause the {$\psi\ast$} values obtained by running the model, to vary within a rather restricted range (within a factor 2, for most of the trophic and environmental conditions), which are similar to those resulting from field studies. The variability of the biomass-normalized primary production can be explained and the seasonal or zonal trends illustrated. The effect of cloudiness is also analysed. This spectral light --- photosynthesis model (a sub model in the more general study of the biomass evolution) can be used either to reproduce primary production experiments and also as a predictive tool in the oceanic carbon fixation problem. The global scale made accessible by satellite techniques requires that a climatological field of the {$\psi\ast$} parameter be produced. This can be done by operating the present model, provided that the physiological factors which intervene are sufficiently ascertained and adequately parameterised, and also provided that the vertical distibution of the algal biomass can be inferred from the partial information (restricted to the upper layer) delivered by ocean colour sensors.},

Chlorophyll-like pigment concentration is used as the index to quantify the algal material (living and detrital), and statistical relationships between this index and the depth of the euphotic layer, the spectral values of the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, or the scattering coefficient are investigated. On the basis of these statistical relationships a pigment-dependent optical model is developed. It allows the propagation of the visible radiant energy within the ocean or the backscattered radiation from the upper layer to be predicted as a function of the local phytoplanktonic content. Other geophysical or geochemical applications are derived which concern the heating rate due to penetrating visible radiations or the rate of energy storage due to photosynthesis. The nonlinear trends observed in the algal biomass-attenuation relationships are analyzed by (1) considering the rather regular change of the living-to-detrital organic carbon ratio which seems to occur in oceanic waters ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and (2) accounting for the respective contributions of absorption (by pigmented cells) and of scattering (by all kind of particulates) in the attenuation process of radiant energy.},

Secondly, we tested whether photacclimation is strain specific. Experiments were conducted over light intensities ranging from 6 to 1500 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 with cultures that were acclimated to low (10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1) and moderate (100 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1) irradiance. The PE-rich strain was sensitive to high light conditions and reached highest photosynthesis and growth rates at low light intensities. The relative effect of photoacclimation was different between the two PC-rich strains, with one strain showing only moderate changes in growth rates in response to the light level used during the acclimation period. Overall, growth rates differed widely in response to light intensity and photoacclimation. Photoacclimation significantly affected both primary production and growth rates of all three strains investigated. We conclude that strain-specific photoacclimation adds to the niche partitioning among closely related freshwater picocyanobacteria.}

In extreme cases, photooxidative damage can cause pigment bleaching and death, a phenomenon all too familiar to anyone who has tried to move a houseplant outdoors into full sunlight.The quantity of the light in natural environments can vary over several orders of magnitude and on a time scale that ranges from seconds to seasons. Because light is such an important environmental parameter, plants have evolved numerous biochemical and developmental responses to light that help to optimize photosynthesis and growth. For example, plants rely on photoreceptors such as phytochrome for shade avoidance responses. Some plants are able to adjust their capacity for harvesting sunlight through leaf and chloroplast movements. During long-term acclimation to changes in light intensity many algae and plants regulate the size of their light-harvesting pigment antennae through changes in gene expression and/or proteolysis. Large antennae are necessary for efficient light capture in limiting light, but they can be a liability when light is abundant or excessive.}

  abstract = {The marine picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus numerically dominate open ocean phytoplankton. Although evolutionarily related they are ecologically distinct, with different strategies to harvest, manage and exploit light. We grew representative strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus and tracked their susceptibility to photoinactivation of Photosystem II under a range of light levels. As expected blue light provoked more rapid photoinactivation than did an equivalent level of red light. The previous growth light level altered the susceptibility of Synechococcus, but not Prochlorococcus, to this photoinactivation. We resolved a simple linear pattern when we expressed the yield of photoinactivation on the basis of photons delivered to Photosystem II photochemistry, plotted versus excitation pressure upon Photosystem II, the balance between excitation and downstream metabolism. A high excitation pressure increases the generation of reactive oxygen species, and thus increases the yield of photoinactivation of Photosystem II. Blue photons, however, retained a higher baseline photoinactivation across a wide range of excitation pressures. Our experiments thus uncovered the relative influences of the direct photoinactivation of Photosystem II by blue photons which dominates under low to moderate blue light, and photoinactivation as a side effect of reactive oxygen species which dominates under higher excitation pressure. Synechococcus enjoyed a positive metabolic return upon the repair or the synthesis of a Photosystem II, across the range of light levels we tested. In contrast Prochlorococcus only enjoyed a positive return upon synthesis of a Photosystem II up to 400 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These differential cost-benefits probably underlie the distinct photoacclimation strategies of the species.},

Here, we describe the design and use of a flat-cuvette photobioreactor that allows accurate control of culture irradiance, temperature, pH, and gas composition combined with real-time monitoring by a built-in fluorometer and densitometer. The high-power LED light source generates precise irradiance levels that are programmed by user-designed protocols. The irradiance, temperature, and gas composition may be static or dynamically modulated, while optical density and pH may be stabilized in turbidostat and pH-stat modes, respectively. We demonstrate that the instrument is able to detect minute variations of growth caused, for example, by sudden dilution or by circadian rhythms. The sensitivity of the instrument is sufficient to monitor suspension optical density as low as 10-2. This newly designed photobioreactor can significantly contribute to the study and use of photoautotrophic microbes in systems biology and biotechnology. Biotechnol.

Triplicate seawater samples were incubated with and without mitomycin C and the abundances of heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria, total viruses and infectious cyanophage were followed over 24 h. Addition of mitomycin C led to increases in total viral abundance as well as the abundance of cyanophages infecting Synechococcus strain DC2. Given typical estimates of burst size, these increases were consistent with 80\% of the heterotrophic bacteria and 0.6\% of Synechococcus cells being inducible by the addition of mitomycin C. This is the highest percentage of lysogens reported for a natural microbial community and demonstrates induction in a marine Synechococcus population. It is likely that the cyanophage production following the addition of mitomycin C was much higher than that titered against a single strain of Synechococcus; hence this estimate is a minimum. In untreated seawater samples, lytic viral production was estimated to remove ca. 27\% of the gross heterotrophic bacterial production, and a minimum of 1.0\% of the gross cyanobacterial production. Our results demonstrate very high levels of lysogeny in the heterotrophic bacterial community, outside of an oligotrophic environment, and the presence of inducible lysogens in Synechococcus spp. during a naturally occurring bloom. These data emphasize the need for further examination of the factors influencing lytic and lysogenic viral infection in natural microbial communities.}

  abstract = {The prototype light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) instrument provides continuous, minimally intrusive, high time resolution ({\textasciitilde}2\,s) assessment of photosynthetic performance in terrestrial plants from up to 2\,m. It induces a chlorophyll fluorescence transient by a series of short flashes in a saturation sequence (180 {\textasciitilde}1{$\mu$}s flashlets in {$<$}380\,{$\mu$}s) to achieve near-full reduction of the primary acceptor QA, followed by a relaxation sequence (RQA; 90 flashlets at exponentially increasing intervals over {\textasciitilde}30\,ms) to observe kinetics of QA re-oxidation. When fitted by the fast repetition rate (FRR) model (Kolber et al. 1998) the QA flash of LIFT/FRR gives smaller values for FmQA from dark adapted leaves than FmPAM from pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) assays. The ratio FmQA/FmPAM resembles the ratio of fluorescence yield at the J/P phases of the classical O-J-I-P transient and we conclude that the difference simply is due to the levels of PQ pool reduction induced by the two techniques. In a strong PAM-analogous WL pulse in the dark monitored by the QA flash of LIFT/FRR {$\varphi$}PSIIWL {$\approx$} {$\varphi$}PSIIPAM. The QA flash also tracks PQ pool reduction as well as the associated responses of ETR QA {$\rightarrow$} PQ and PQ {$\rightarrow$} PSI, the relative functional ({$\sigma$}PSII) and optical absorption (aPSII) cross-sections of PSII in situ with a time resolution of {\textasciitilde}2\,s as they relax after the pulse. It is impractical to deliver strong WL pulses at a distance in the field but a longer PQ flash from LIFT/FRR also achieves full reduction of PQ pool and delivers {$\varphi$}PSIIPQ {$\approx$} {$\varphi$}PSIIPAM to obtain PAM-equivalent estimates of ETR and NPQ at a distance. In situ values of {$\sigma$}PSII and aPSII from the QA flash with smaller antenna barley (chlorina-f2) and Arabidopsis mutants (asLhcb2--12, ch1--3 Lhcb5) are proportionally similar to those previously reported from in vitro assays. These direct measurements are further validated by changes in antenna size in response to growth irradiance. We illustrate how the QA flash facilitates our understanding of photosynthetic regulation during sun flecks in natural environments at a distance, with a time resolution of a few seconds.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton primary productivity is most commonly measured by 14C assimilation although less direct methods, such as O2 exchange, have also been employed. These methods are invasive, requiring bottle incubation for up to 24 h. As an alternative, Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) has been used, on wide temporal and spatial scales within aquatic systems, to estimate photosystem II (PSII) electron flux per unit volume (JVPSII), which generally correlates well with photosynthetic O2 evolution. A major limitation of using FRRf arises from the need to employ an independent method to determine the concentration of functional photosystem II reaction centers ([RCII]); a requirement that has prevented FRR fluorometers being used, as stand-alone instruments, for the estimation of electron transport. Within this study, we have taken a new approach to the analysis of FRRf data, based on a simple hypothesis; that under a given set of environmental conditions, the ratio of rate constants for RCII fluorescence emission and photochemistry falls within a narrow range, for all groups of phytoplankton. We present a simple equation, derived from the established FRRf algorithm, for determining [RCII] from dark FRRf data alone. We also describe an entirely new algorithm for estimating JVPSII, which does not require determination of [RCII] and is valid for a heterogeneous model of connectivity among RCIIs. Empirical supporting evidence is presented. These data are derived from FRR measurements across a diverse range of microalgae, in parallel with independent measurements of [RCII]. Possible sources of error, particularly under nutrient stress conditions, are discussed.},

Although this parameter provides a reliable estimate of photosynthetic efficiency under most conditions, the extent to which this efficiency is defined by (i) competition with other energy-dissipating processes operating at photosystem II and (ii) by processes on the reducing side of photosystem II, such as carbon assimilation, requires the use of additional parameters. Of particular value are qP, which quantifies the photochemical capacity of photosystem II, and Fv-;/Fm-;, which quantifies the extent to which photochemistry at photosystem II is limited by competition with thermal decay processes. Imaging of both qP and Fv-;/Fm-; requires measurement of Fo-; (the minimum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state), which cannot be imaged with existing systems. In this paper, a method is described which estimates Fo-; through a simple equation involving the minimum fluorescence yield in the dark-adapted state (Fo), the maximum fluorescence yield in the dark-adapted state (Fm), and the maximum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state (Fm-;). This method is tested here, through comparison of measured and calculated values of Fo-;.

However, most isolates of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus naturally miss these proteins, even though they have kept the main OEC protein, PsbO. A structural homology model of the PSII of such a natural deletion mutant strain (P. marinus MED4) did not reveal any obvious compensation mechanism for this lack. To assess the physiological consequences of this unusual OEC, we compared oxygen evolution between Prochlorococcus strains missing psbU and psbV (PCC 9511 and SS120) and two marine strains possessing these genes (Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803). While the low light-adapted strain SS120 exhibited the lowest maximal O2 evolution rates (Pmax per divinyl-chlorophyll a, per cell or per photosystem II) of all four strains, the high light-adapted strain PCC 9511 displayed even higher PChlmax and PPSIImax at high irradiance than Synechococcus sp. WH7803. Furthermore, thermoluminescence glow curves did not show any alteration in the B-band shape or peak position that could be related to the lack of these extrinsic proteins. This suggests an efficient functional adaptation of the OEC in these natural deletion mutants, in which PsbO alone is seemingly sufficient to ensure proper oxygen evolution. Our study also showed that Prochlorococcus strains exhibit negative net O2 evolution rates at the low irradiances encountered in minimum oxygen zones, possibly explaining the very low O2 concentrations measured in these environments, where Prochlorococcus is the dominant oxyphototroph.},

With respect to these characteristics, all cyanobacteria included in this study were assigned to four different types: (1) strains without the capability to fix N2 or to perform CCA of the group III type (CCA III); (2) strains which show both features; (3) strains with the ability to fix nitrogen, but that do not show any CCA III; and (4) strains that produce phycoerythrin, but without the capacity for CCA III or N2-fixation. By examining the frequency distribution of isolates, these types were shown to prefer different habitats. While cyanobacterial strains capable of N2-fixation, but without CCA III, were mainly obtained from stone crusts in the supralittoral zone, those with the potential for N2-fixation as well as for CCA III were largely isolated from submersed macrophytes. Cyanobacteria that produce phycoerythrin, but do not perform CCA III or N2-fixation, were found in the pelagic zone only.}

In synthetic media of the ASP type it grows as a pin-cushion composed of uniseriate branching filaments. Only occasionally some finger-like germlings appear which, after a few millimeters growth, disintegrate and originate the branched uniseriate filaments. Many strains of marine bacteria, isolated from               Ulva               and other seaweeds collected in nature or from laboratory cultures, when grown together with this axenic               Ulva,               induced growth of long thin               Enteromorpha-               like tubes (active bacteria). Other bacterial strains have no visible morphological effect on the               Ulva               (inactive). Combinations of several active and inactive bacterial strains result in flat ribbons which can be wide or narrow and with distromatic portions intercalated between tubular portions. No combination has so far induced the axenic               Ulva               to produce the typical expanded foliose thallus. Bacterial filtrates are inactive; syntrophic growth seems indispensable. The bacterial strains lose the ability to induce morphogenic effects on the axenic               Ulva               when grown for several transfers in organic marine media and regain it by growing with               Ulva               for several transfers in synthetic mineral media. Each partner appears therefore to be dependent on the metabolites produced by the other. The perpetuation of a wide morphological versatility of this laboratory strain of               Ulva               after 15 yr maintenance under under artificial conditions emphasizes the phylogenetic importance of this versatility.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} A natural plankton community from oligotrophic subtropical waters of the Atlantic near Gran Canaria, Spain, was subjected to varying degrees of ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) to assess the potential physiological effects, in the context of the application of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques. We employed 8.3 m\textsuperscript{3} mesocosms with a sediment trap attached to the bottom, creating a gradient in total alkalinity (TA). The lowest point on this gradient was 2400 \&mu;mol \&middot; L\textsuperscript{-1}, which corresponded to the natural alkalinity of the environment, and the highest point was 4800 \&mu;mol \&middot; L\textsuperscript{-1}. Over the course of the 33-day experiment, the plankton community exhibited two distinct phases. In phase-I (days 5\&ndash;20), a notable decline in the photosynthetic efficiency (F\textsubscript{v}/F\textsubscript{m}) was observed. This change was accompanied by substantial reductions in the abundances of picoeukaryotes, small size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-1), and microplankton. The cell viability of picoeukaryotes, as indicated by fluorescein-di-acetate hydrolysis by cellular esterases (FDA- green fluorescence), slightly increased by the end of phase-I whilst the viability of nanoeukaryotes 1 and {$<$}em{$>$}Synechococcus spp{$<$}/em{$>$} . did not change. Reactive oxygen species levels (ROS-green fluorescence) showed no significant changes for any of the functional groups. In contrast, in phase-II (days 21\&ndash;33), a pronounced community response was observed. Increases in F\textsubscript{v}/F\textsubscript{m} in the intermediate OAE treatments of ∆900 to ∆1800 \&mu;mol \&middot; L\textsuperscript{-1 } and in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chlorophyll-c2 (Chl-c2) , fucoxanthin and divinyl-Chl-a were attributed to the emergence of blooms of large size nanoeukaryotes (nanoeukaryotes-2) from the genera {$<$}em{$>$}Chrysochromulina{$<$}/em{$>$}, as well as picoeukaryotes. {$<$}em{$>$}Synechococcus spp{$<$}/em{$>$}. also flourished towards the end of this phase. In parallel, we observed a total 20 \% significant change in the metaproteome of the phytoplankton community. This is considered a significant alteration in protein expression, having substantial impacts on cellular functions and the physiology of the organisms. Medium levels of ∆TA showed more upregulated and less downregulated proteins than higher ∆TA treatments. Under these conditions, cell viability significantly increased in pico and nanoeukaryotes-1 in intermediate alkalinity levels, while in {$<$}em{$>$}Synechococcus spp{$<$}/em{$>$}., nanoeukaryotes-2 and microplankton remained stable. ROS levels did not significantly change in any functional group. The pigment ratios DD+DT : FUCO, and DD+DT : Chl-a increased in medium ∆TA treatments, supporting the idea of nutrient deficiency alleviation and the absence of physiological stress. Taken all data together, this study shows that there is minimal evidence indicating a harmful impact of high alkalinity on the plankton community. The OAE treatments did not result in physiological fitness impairment, thus OAE did not cause cellular stress in the phytoplankton community studied.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The mechanism of charge recombination of the S2QA- state in photosystem II was investigated by modifying the free energy gap between the quinone acceptor QA and the primary pheophytin acceptor Ph. This was done either by changing the midpoint potential of Ph (using mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis with a modified hydrogen bond to this cofactor), or that of QA (using different inhibitors of the QB pocket). The results show that the recombination rate is dependent on the free energy gap between Ph and QA, which confirms that the indirect recombination pathway involving formation of Ph- has a significant contribution. In the mutant with the largest free energy gap, direct electron transfer from QA- to P+ predominates. The temperature dependence of the recombination rate was investigated, showing a lower activation enthalpy in this mutant compared with the WT. The data allow the determination of the rate of the direct route and of its relative weight in the various strains. The set of currently accepted values for the midpoint potentials of the QA/QA-, Ph/Ph-, and P+/P* couples is not consistent with the relatively rapid rate of the indirect recombination pathway found here, nor with the 3\% yield of delayed fluorescence as previously estimated by de Grooth and van Gorkom (1981, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 635, 445-456). It is argued that a likely explanation is that the midpoint potentials of the two latter couples are more positive than believed due to electrostatic interactions. If such is the case, the estimation of the midpoint potential of the P+/P and S2/S1 couples must also be revised upward, with values of 1260 and 1020 mV, respectively.}

  abstract = {The essential steps of photosynthetic water splitting take place in Photosystem II (PSII) and comprise three different reaction sequences: (i) light induced formation of the radical pair P680+ QA-, (ii) P680+ driven oxidative water splitting into O2 and four protons, and (iii) two step plastoquinone reduction to plastoquinol by QA-. This mini-review briefly summarizes our state of knowledge on energetics, kinetics and mechanism of oxidative water splitting. Essential features of the two types of reactions involved are described: (a) P680+ reduction by the redox active tyrosine Yz and (b) sequence of oxidation steps induced by Yzox in the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). The rate of the former reaction is limited by the non-adiabatic electron transfer (NET) step and the multi-phase kinetics shown to originate from a sequence of relaxation processes. In marked contrast, the rate of the stepwise oxidation by Yzox of the WOC up to the redox level S3 is not limited by NET but by trigger reactions which probably comprise proton shifts and/or conformational changes. The overall rate of the final reaction sequence leading to formation and release of O2 is assumed to be limited by the electron transfer step from the S3 state of WOC to Yzox due to involvement of an endergonic redox equilibrium. Currently discussed controversial ideas on possible pathways are briefly outlined. Several crucial points of the mechanism of oxidative water splitting, like O--O bond formation, role of local proton shift(s), details of hydrogen bonding, are still not clarified and remain a challenging topic of future research.},

These equations for different solvents give chlorophyll assays that are consistent with each other. No algorithms for Chl c compounds (c2, c1~+~c2) in the presence of Chl a have previously been published for methanol or ethanol. The limits of detection (and inherent error,~{\textpm}~95\% confidence limit), for chlorophylls in all organisms tested, was generally less than 0.1~{\textmu}g/ml. The Chl a and b algorithms for green algae and land plants have very small inherent errors ({$<~$}0.01~{\textmu}g/ml). Chl a and d algorithms for Acaryochlorismarina are consistent with each other, giving estimates of Chl d/a ratios which are consistent with previously published estimates using HPLC and a rarely used algorithm originally published for diethyl ether in 1955. The statistical error structure of chlorophyll algorithms is discussed. The relative error of measurements of chlorophylls increases hyperbolically in diluted chlorophyll extracts because the inherent errors of the chlorophyll algorithms are constants independent of the magnitude of absorbance readings. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of chlorophylls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of chlorophylls. The methanol algorithms would be convenient for assays associated with HPLC work.},

The rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution decreased more slowly with temperature than the growth rate, and more than 20\% of the activity at 38{$^\circ$}C remained at 15{$^\circ$}C. Oxygen evolution was rapidly inactivated at high light intensity (3 mE m-2 s-1) at 15{$^\circ$}C. Little or no loss of oxygen evolution was observed under the normal light intensity (250 {$\mu$}E m-2 s-1) for growth at 15{$^\circ$}C. The decrease in the rate of nitrate consumption by cells as a function of temperature was similar to the decrease in the growth rate. Cells could not actively take up nitrate or nitrite at 15{$^\circ$}C, although nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase were still active. These data demonstrate that growth at low temperature is not limited by a decrease in the rate of photosynthetic electron transport or by photoinhibition, but that inactivation of the nitrate/nitrite transporter limits growth at low temperature.}

Little is known about their close relatives from freshwater and non-marine environments. Phylogenomic analyses (using 136 proteins) provide strong support for the monophyly of a clade of non-marine picocyanobacteria consisting of {$<$}italic{$>$}Cyanobium, Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} and marine Sub-cluster 5.2; this clade itself is sister to marine {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} and {$<$}italic{$>$}Prochlorococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$}. The most basal lineage within the Syn/Pro clade, Sub-Cluster 5.3, includes marine and freshwater strains. Relaxed molecular clock (SSU, LSU) analyses show that while ancestors of the Syn/Pro clade date as far back as the end of the Pre-Cambrian, modern crown groups evolved during the Carboniferous and Triassic. Comparative genomic analyses reveal novel gene cluster arrangements involved in phycobilisome (PBS) metabolism in freshwater strains. Whilst PBS genes in marine {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} are mostly found in one type of phycoerythrin (PE) rich gene cluster (Type III), strains from non-marine habitats, so far, appear to be more diverse both in terms of pigment content and gene arrangement, likely reflecting a wider range of habitats. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the PE genes ({$<$}italic{$>$}mpeBA{$<$}/italic{$>$}) evolved via a duplication of the {$<$}italic{$>$}cpeBA{$<$}/italic{$>$} genes in an ancestor of the marine and non-marine picocyanobacteria and of the symbiotic strains {$<$}italic{$>$}Synechococcus spongiarum{$<$}/italic{$>$}.

In this study, the physiological properties of the long-term nitrogen-starved cells are investigated in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of maintenance of viability. Preservation of energetic homeostasis is based on a low level of residual photosynthesis; activities of photosystem II and photosystem I were approximately 0.1\% of activities of vegetatively growing cells. The low levels of photosystem I activity were measured by a novel colorimetric assay developed from the activity staining of ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Photosystem II reaction centers, as determined by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, exhibited normal properties, although the efficiency of light harvesting was significantly reduced compared with that of control cells. Long-term chlorotic cells carried out protein synthesis at a very low, but detectable level, as revealed by in vivo [35S]methionine labeling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In conjunction with the very low levels of total cellular protein contents, this implies a continuous protein turnover during chlorosis. Synthesis of components of the photosynthetic apparatus could be detected, whereas factors of the translational machinery were stringently down-regulated. Beyond the massive loss of protein during acclimation to nitrogen deprivation, two proteins that were identified as SomA and SomB accumulated due to an induced expression following nitrogen reduction.},

Prochlorococcus was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. The genus comprises specific ecotypes which are phylogenetically distinct and differ markedly in their photophysiology, allowing growth over a broad range of light and nutrient conditions within the 45{$^\circ$}N to 40{$^\circ$}S latitudinal belt that they occupy. Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are closely related, together forming a discrete picophytoplankton clade, but are distinguishable by their possession of dissimilar light-harvesting apparatuses and differences in cell size and elemental composition. Synechococcus strains have a ubiquitous oceanic distribution compared to that of Prochlorococcus strains and are characterized by phylogenetically discrete lineages with a wide range of pigmentation. In this review, we put our current knowledge of marine picocyanobacterial genomics into an environmental context and present previously unpublished genomic information arising from extensive genomic comparisons in order to provide insights into the adaptations of these marine microbes to their environment and how they are reflected at the genomic level.},

  abstract = {Picocyanobacteria of the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus numerically dominate vast tracts of the world's oceans and contribute a significant proportion of primary production, particularly in oligotrophic regions. The ecological success of these two genera suggests they possess sophisticated strategies to respond to variations in their environment. Indeed, it appears that it is the in situ community structure of these organisms which underlies this success, with the existence of specific ecotypes or lineages occupying different niches to populate the world's oceans. For Prochlorococcus there is now excellent physiological and genomic data for defining the basis of this niche partitioning particularly with respect to its vertical distribution down a water column. The situation for Synechococcus is more complex probably due to the larger spatial distribution of marine Synechococcus in oceanic ecosystems. This has led to extensive phylogenetic and physiological variation within the Synechococcus genus but the genomic basis for this phenotypic variation, and hence niche adaptation is less well understood. This chapter seeks to give an overview of the knowledge gained on these organisms over the last three decades focusing on aspects of ecology, physiology and molecular biology that are pertinent to this niche adaptation process.},

Spectral line parameters, principally intensities and air-broadening coefficients, are derived from Fourier transform spectroscopic measurements at high resolution (0.03 cm-1), a range of optical path lengths (5--513 m), and temperatures of both 252 and 296 K. Experimental line parameters are derived for 5034 assigned transitions and thorough error analysis shows parameter errors of less than 2.5\% for one-third and less than 5\% for over half of the lines. Calculated spectra, derived using these line parameters, reproduce the original spectra to within 2\%. A comparison of the line intensities with those in the HITRAN-96 database identifies large errors in the latter with random differences that exceed a factor of two for many lines, and systematic differences between 6 and 26\% depending on the water band under consideration. The recent corrections to the HITRAN database by Giver et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer66, 101--105 (2000)) do not remove these discrepancies and the differences change to 6--38\%. The new data are expected to substantially increase the calculated absorption of solar energy due to water vapor in climate models.}

Instead of the usual three phases, i.e., lag-, log-, and stationary phase, phototrophs display four distinct phases. The extra growth phase is a phase of linear, light-limited growth that follows the exponential phase and is often ignored as being different. Results of this study demonstrate marked growth phase-dependent alterations in the photophysiology of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 between cells harvested from the exponential and the linear growth phase. Notable differences are a gradual shift in the energy transfer of the light-harvesting phycobilisomes to the photosystems and a distinct change in the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. These differences will likely affect the result of physiological studies and the efficiency of product formation of Synechocystis in biotechnological applications. Our study also demonstrates that the length of the period of exponential growth can be extended by a gradually stronger incident light intensity that matches the increase of the cell density of the culture.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are known to have unique capability of nitrogen fixation in their specialized cell known as heterocyst. However, differentiation of vegetative cell toward heterocyst reduces competitive ability of cyanobacteria because it led to a shift of energy allocation from carbon to nitrogen metabolism. Therefore, heterocyst formation is regulated to avoid the differentiation commitment due to short-term nitrogen fluctuation. Once nitrogen deficiency signal is sensed by the cyanobacteria, pattern of heterocyst formation is determined that ensures equidistance formation of heterocyst cells with about one heterocyst per ten vegetative cells. After differentiation, heterocyst provides anaerobic condition that is prerequisite for the nitrogenase complex to fix the atmospheric dinitrogen. Microoxic condition inside the heterocyst is attained by elimination of oxygen-producing photosystem II activity, increasing respiration rate, and by formation of thick heterocyst-specific exopolysaccharide and glycolipid layer. Nitrogen-fixing machinery is assembled and activated during heterocyst differentiation. The nitrogenase complex is encoded by nif gene family. Many of these genes are interrupted in the vegetative cells by interruption elements and these are excised during differentiation of heterocyst by a site-specific recombinase, leading to the activation of genes. In this chapter, we have outlined the molecular circuit of heterocyst differentiation and discussed the assembly of nitrogen-fixing machinery and role of key enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism in the cyanobacteria.},

We used the strains of Synechococcus temperature ecotypes to study how light utilization has evolved in the function of temperature. The tropical Synechococcus (clade II) was unable to grow under 16 {$^\circ$}C but, at temperatures {$>$}25 {$^\circ$}C, induced very high growth rates that relied on a strong synthesis of the components of the photosynthetic machinery, leading to a large increase in photosystem cross-section and electron flux. By contrast, the Synechococcus adapted to subpolar habitats (clade I) grew more slowly but was able to cope with temperatures {$<$}10 {$^\circ$}C. We show that growth at such temperatures was accompanied by a large increase of the photoprotection capacities using the orange carotenoid protein (OCP). Metagenomic analyzes revealed that Synechococcus natural communities show the highest prevalence of the ocp genes in low-temperature niches, whereas most tropical clade II Synechococcus have lost the gene. Moreover, bioinformatic analyzes suggested that the OCP variants of the two cold-adapted Synechococcus clades I and IV have undergone evolutionary convergence through the adaptation of the molecular flexibility. Our study points to an important role of temperature in the evolution of the OCP. We, furthermore, discuss the implications of the different metabolic cost of these physiological strategies on the competitiveness of Synechococcus in a warming ocean. This study can help improve the current hypotheses and models aimed at predicting the changes in ocean carbon fluxes in response to global warming.}

Filling the gap in our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the proliferation of these organisms could provide a better understanding of aquatic environments.

We also examined the relationships between climate change and representative picocyanobacterial genera from freshwater, brackish and marine ecosystems.

  abstract = {The contribution of picocyanobacteria (PCY) to summer phytoplankton blooms, accompanied by an ecological crisis is a new phenomenon in Europe. This issue requires careful investigation. The present study examined the response of Synechococcus sp. physiology to different environmental conditions. Three strains of Synechococcus sp. (red BA-120, green BA-124, and brown BA-132) were cultivated in a laboratory under previously determined environmental conditions. These conditions were as follows: temperature (T) from 10 by 5 to 25\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C, salinity from 3 by 5 to 18 PSU, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from 10 by 90 to 280\&thinsp;{\textmu}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m-2\&thinsp;s-1, which gave 64 combinations of synthetic, though realistic, environmental scenarios. Scenarios reflecting all possible combinations were applied in the laboratory experiments. Results pointed to differences in final numbers of cells among strains. However, there was also a similar tendency for BA-124 and BA-132, which demonstrated the highest concentrations of PCY cells at elevated T and PAR. This was also the case for BA-120 but only to a certain degree as the number of cells started to decrease above 190\&thinsp;{\textmu}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m-2\&thinsp;s-1\&thinsp;PAR. Pigmentation, chlorophyll a (Chl a), fluorescence, and rate of photosynthesis presented both similarities and differences among strains. In this context, more consistent features were observed between brown and red strains when compared to the green. In this paper, the ecophysiological responses of PCY are defined.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that the genus Synechococcus is responsible for about 17\% of net primary production in the Global Ocean. Blooms of these organisms are observed in tropical, subtropical and even temperate zones, and they have been recorded recently even beyond the polar circle. The long-term scenarios forecast a growing expansion of Synechococcus sp. and its area of dominance. This is, among others, due to their high physiological plasticity in relation to changing environmental conditions. Three phenotypes of the genus Synechococcus sp. (Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3a) were tested in controlled laboratory conditions in order to identify their response to various irradiance (10, 55, 100 and 145 {\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1) and temperature (15, 22.5 and 30 {$^\circ$}C) conditions. The highest total pigment content per cell was recorded at 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at all temperature variants with the clear dominance of phycobilins among all the pigments. In almost every variant the highest growth rate was recorded for the Type 1. The lowest growth rates were observed, in general, for the Type 3a. However, it was recognized to be less temperature sensitive in comparison to the other two types and rather light-driven with the highest plasticity and adaptation potential. The highest amounts of carotenoids were produced by Type 2 which also showed signs of the cell stress even around 55 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at 15 {$^\circ$}C and 22.5 {$^\circ$}C. This may imply that the Type 2 is the most susceptible to higher irradiances. Picocyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. require less light intensity to achieve the maximum rate of photosynthesis than larger algae. They also tolerate a wide range of temperatures which combined together make them gain a powerful competitive advantage. Our results will provide key information for the ecohydrodynamical model development. Thus, this work would be an important link in forecasting future changes in the occurrence of these organisms in the context of global warming.},

  abstract = {The cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. PCC 7601 can adapt its pigment content in response to changes in the incident light wavelength. It synthesizes, as major light-harvesting pigments, either phycocyanin 2 (PC2, encoded by the cpc2 operon) under red light or phycoerythrin (PE, encoded by the cpeBA operon) under green light conditions. The last step of the signal transduction pathway is characterized by a transcriptional control of the expression of these operons. Partially purified protein extracts were used in gel retardation assays and DNase I footprinting experiments to identify the factors that interact with the promoter region of the cpeBA operon. We found that two proteins, RcaA and RcaB, only detected in extracts of cells grown under green light, behave as positive transcriptional factors for the expression of the cpeBA operon. Treatment of the fractions containing RcaA and RcaB with alkaline phosphatase prevents the binding of RcaA but not of RcaB to the cpeBA promoter region. A post-translational modification of RcaA thus modulates its affinity for DNA.}

From the accompanying microbial flora of established laboratory strains of               U. mutabilis               with normal morphology, a               Roseobacter               , a               Sulfitobacter               , and a               Halomonas               species were isolated. Each of these microbe species alone induced the development of the               Ulva               gametes into thalli composed of differentiated cells with characteristic deficiencies. Typical traits of these thalli were: an enhanced rate of cell division not followed by cell expansion, the presence of unusual cell wall protrusions, and the absence of differentiated rhizoid cells. The addition of a               Cytophaga               species, also derived from the same microbial flora, to either one of the three other strains resulted in the development of normal fast growing thalli with the typical morphology of the algal strain used. These effects are mediated by specific regulatory factors that are excreted into the environment by the bacteria and could be also isolated from the bacterial cell extracts. In contrast with the               Cytophaga               -factor, the regulatory factor of the three other bacterial species was also found intracellularly in other bacterial strains not associated with               Ulva               , but in this case it was not excreted. Functionally, the               Roseobacter               -,               Sulfitobacter-,               and               Halomonas-               factors resemble a cytokinin, while the               Cytophaga               -factor acts similar to auxin. Neither factor could be replaced by known phytohormones. The               Roseobacter               species exhibits a specific chemotactic affinity to the rhizoid cells of               U. mutabilis               and seems to cooperate with the               Cytophaga               strain and the alga by chemical communication forming a symbiotic tripartite community.},

They contain brightly colored phycobiliproteins (PBP) and form giant supramolecular complexes (up to 3000--7000 kDa) containing 200 to 500 phycobilin chromophores covalently bound to the proteins. There are over ten various PBP known, which falls into one of three groups: phycoerythrins, phycocyanins, and allophycocyanins. Hollow disks of PBP trimers and hexamers are arranged into cylinders by colorless linker proteins; the cylinders are then assembled into PBS. Typical semidiscoidal PBS consists of a central core formed by three allophycocyanin cylinders and of six lateral cylinders consisting of other PBP and attached as a fan to the nucleus. The PBS number, size, and pigment composition in cyanobacteria depend on light conditions and other ambient factors. While PBSs have certain advantages compared to other antennae, these pigment-protein complexes require more energy for their biosynthesis than the chlorophyll a/b and chlorophyll a/c proteins of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.},

Complementary chromatic adaptation is a colorful form of phenotypic plasticity, where cyanobacteria tune their pigmentation to the prevailing light spectrum. Here, we study the timescale of chromatic adaptation and its impact on competition among phytoplankton species exposed to fluctuating light colors. We parameterized a resource competition model using monoculture experiments with green and red picocyanobacteria and the cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena, which can change its color within {$\sim$}7 days by chromatic adaptation. The model predictions were tested in competition experiments, where the incident light color switched between red and green at different frequencies (slow, intermediate, and fast). Pseudanabaena (the flexible phenotype) competitively excluded the green and red picocyanobacteria in all competition experiments. Strikingly, the rate of competitive exclusion was much faster when the flexible phenotype had sufficient time to fully adjust its pigmentation. Thus, the flexible phenotype benefited from its phenotypic plasticity if fluctuations in light color were relatively slow, corresponding to slow mixing processes or infrequent storms in their natural habitat. This shows that the timescale of phenotypic plasticity plays a key role during species interactions in fluctuating environments.},

Here we compare simultaneous measurements of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II obtained from the two techniques and independent estimates of the rate of light absorption by photosystem II. We measured the light-dependencies of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) in five phytoplankters using FRR and Xe-PAM approaches. The FRR and PAM estimates were related in a non-linear fashion. At low irradiances, Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} measured using PAM fluorescence exceeded Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} measured using FRR fluorescence by about 20\%. At high irradiances, measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} from the two approaches converged. The differences in Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} reflect the distinct techniques by which FRR and PAM protocols excite PSII and are amplified when estimating electron transfer rates as a result of the irradiance term. We also found that measurements of the effective light absorption cross-section for photosystem II obtained by FRR fluorescence compared well with estimates obtained from measured light absorption and photosynthetic unit size. Finally, we compared the photon efficiency of gross oxygen evolution from measurements of gross oxygen evolution and light absorption ({$\Phi$}PO2 18) with FRR measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}. We found that measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} were highly linearly correlated, but were lower by a factor of {$\sim$}1.5, than {$\Phi$}PO2 18.},

The three-dimensional spheroidal-pore model of digital core was established based on mesoscopic mechanical theory. The constitutive relationship of different types of pore microstructure deformation was studied with Eshelby equivalent medium theory, and the effects of pore microstructure on pore volume compressibility under elastic deformation conditions of single and multiple pores of a single type and mixed types of pores were investigated. The results showed that the pore volume compressibility coefficient of digital core is closely related with porosity, pore aspect ratio and volumetric proportions of different types of pores. (1) The compressibility coefficient of prolate ellipsoidal pore is positively correlated with the pore aspect ratio, while that of oblate ellipsoidal pore is negatively correlated with the pore aspect ratio. (2) At the same mean value of pore aspect ratio satisfying Gaussian distribution, the more concentrated the range of pore aspect ratio, the higher the compressibility coefficient of both prolate and oblate ellipsoidal pores will be, and the larger the deformation under the same stress condition. (3) The pore compressibility coefficient increases with porosity. (4) At a constant porosity value, the higher the proportion of oblate ellipsoidal and spherical pores in the rock, the more easier for the rock to deform, and the higher the compressibility coefficient of the rock is, while the higher the proportion of prolate ellipsoidal pores in the rock, the more difficult it is for rock to deform, and the lower the compressibility coefficient of the rock is. By calculating pore compressibility coefficient of ten classical digital rock samples, the presented analytical elliptical-pore model based on real pore structure of digital rocks can be applied to calculation of pore volume compressibility coefficient of digital rock sample.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Ulva               green tides have adversely affected coastal ecosystems. In June 2023 in Changhua County, Taiwan, an unprecedented floating tubular               Ulva               bloom spanning about 30\,km of coastline caused about 30\,\% reduction in oyster yield as reported by local farmers. Understanding its taxonomic and ecological basis is crucial for preemptive and remedial measures. Based on molecular (               rbc               L and               tuf               A) and morphological evidence,               U               lva               meridionalis               was the cause of this green tide. Haplotype network analysis (based on ITS) suggests that this green tide originated from northern China via the China Coastal Current. Historical survey data indicate that               U               .               meridionalis               arrived in Taoyuan Algal Reef (about 150\,km north of the bloom area) as far back as 2018. Our ecophysiological experiments revealed that               U               .               meridionalis               exhibited a rapid daily growth rate with biomass increment up to 13--21\,\% when subjected to local nutrient-rich waters under lower salinity and spring-like conditions. Although historical ecological and poultry/livestock data analyses showed no noticeable change in sea surface temperature and rainfall over the past decade, a gradual rise in agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus output was observed. This taxonomic and ecological background lays the groundwork for long-term ecological monitoring. Moreover, this study exemplifies the detrimental impact of an unforeseen               Ulva               bloom on oyster farming.},

Here, we used a widespread macroalga often involved in blooms,               Ulva               spp., to investigate how supply of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), the two main potential growth-limiting nutrients, influence macroalgal growth in temperate and tropical coastal waters ranging from low- to high-nutrient supplies. We carried out N and P enrichment field experiments on               Ulva               spp. in seven coastal systems, with one of these systems represented by three different subestuaries, for a total of nine sites. We showed that rate of growth of               Ulva               spp. was directly correlated to annual dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, where growth increased with increasing DIN concentration. Internal N pools of macroalgal fronds were also linked to increased DIN supply, and algal growth rates were tightly coupled to these internal N pools. The increases in DIN appeared to be related to greater inputs of wastewater to these coastal waters as indicated by high               {$\delta$}               15               N signatures of the algae as DIN increased. N and P enrichment experiments showed that rate of macroalgal growth was controlled by supply of DIN where ambient DIN concentrations were low, and by P where DIN concentrations were higher, regardless of latitude or geographic setting. These results suggest that understanding the basis for macroalgal blooms, and management of these harmful phenomena, will require information as to nutrient sources, and actions to reduce supply of N and P in coastal waters concerned.},

This paper presents experimental line positions, experimental-quality energy levels, and validated labels for rotational--vibrational transitions of the most abundant isotopologue of water, H216O. The latest version of the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational--Vibrational Energy Levels) line-inversion procedure is used to determine the rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of H216O from experimentally measured lines, together with their self-consistent uncertainties, for the spectral region up to the first dissociation limit. The spectroscopic network of H216O containstwo components, an ortho (o) and a para (p) one. For o-H216O and p-H216O, experimentally measured, assigned, and labeled transitions were analyzed from more than 100 sources. The measured lines come from one-photon spectra recorded at room temperature in absorption, from hot samples with temperatures up to 3000K recorded in emission, and from multiresonance excitation spectra which sample levels up to dissociation. The total number of transitions considered is 184667 of which 182156 are validated: 68027 between para states and 114129 ortho ones. These transitions give rise to 18486 validated energy levels, of which 10446 and 8040 belong to o-H216O and p-H216O, respectively. The energy levels, including their labeling with approximate normal-mode and rigid-rotor quantum numbers, have been checked against ones determined from accurate variational nuclear motion computations employing exact kinetic energy operators as well as against previous compilations of energy levels. The extensive list of MARVEL lines and levels obtained are deposited in the supplementary data of this paper, as well as in a distributed information system applied to water, W@DIS, where they can easily be retrieved.},

  abstract = {Light fluctuations are ubiquitous, exist across multiple spatial and temporal scales, and directly affect the physiology and ecology of photoautotrophs. However, the indirect effects of light fluctuations on the sensitivity of organisms to other key environmental factors are unclear. Here, we evaluate how photoperiod regime (period of time each day where organisms receive light), a dynamic element of aquatic ecosystems, can influence the interactive effects of temperature and irradiance (intensity of light) on the growth rate of phytoplankton populations. We first completed a literature review and meta-analysis that suggests photoperiod alters the individual effects of temperature -- but not irradiance -- on algal growth rates and that highlights how few studies experimentally manipulate photoperiod, temperature and irradiance. To address this empirical gap, we conducted a set of laboratory experiments on three freshwater phytoplankton species (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris and Cryptomonas ovata). We measured performance surfaces relating growth rate to irradiance and temperature gradients for each species in constant (24:0 h of light:dark) environments. We then evaluated whether analogous surfaces measured under different photoperiods (6:18, 12:12 and 16:8 h of light:dark) and scaled by the duration of light availability could be inferred from results under constant light. For a majority of the combinations of species and photoperiods examined, photoperiod meaningfully altered the intercept and shape of performance surfaces. These differences were most pronounced under the shortest photoperiod (6:18 h light:dark), where populations underperformed expectations. Alterations to performance surfaces were non-linear and mostly structured by temperature with higher temperatures yielding higher than anticipated growth rates. Collectively, these experiments and synthesis reveal the potential for photoperiod regime to influence the effects of temperature, irradiance and their interaction on phytoplankton growth. Beyond the environmental variables and organisms presently considered, this research highlights the capacity for dynamic, abiotic variables to exert direct effects while also influencing relationships among other environmental factors.},

(CCMP 839), Pelagomonas calceolata (CCMP 1756) and Prasinomonas capsulatus (CCMP 1617) in order to collect physiological parameters for pico-phytoplankton to be utilised in Ocean Biogeochemical Climate Models. The main parameters to follow the effects of ammonium, phosphate, iron and light limitation were cell growth rates ({$\mu$}), half saturation constants for growth (Km), N, P and Fe quota (per cell or per mol C), and photochemical quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm). The nitrate and phosphate limitation experiments demonstrated that the small phytoplankton species could grow at low N and P concentrations. Km values were in the micro-molar (NH4+) and sub-micro-molar (PO43-) range. N and P quota were in the femto-molar range per cell and varied from nutrient-deplete to nutrient-replete conditions. Fv/Fm values were only adversely affected at the lowest N and P concentrations in these experiments. In the Fe limitation experiments, it was shown that all three species were adversely affected only at extremely low Fe concentrations. Iron chelating agents had to be added to force the species in Fe limitation till ultimately growth stopped. Km values with respect to dissolved Fe were in the femto-molar range. Fe quota were in the low zepto-molar (10-21 M) range per cell, and varied considerably from Fe limiting to Fe replete growth conditions. Fv/Fm values diminished only at the lowest iron concentrations. In the light limitation experiments, growth rates and photochemical quantum efficiencies were adversely affected only at irradiance levels below 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These results indicate that the pico-phytoplankton species will hardly ever be completely stopped in their growth by NH4+, PO43-, Fe or light (separately) under natural conditions.},

  abstract = {1. We studied the seasonal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in a turbid, large shallow lake during an annual period (2005--06). We relate the patterns of seston concentration (total suspended solids), phytoplankton biomass and water transparency to the seasonal pattern of incident solar radiation (I0). We also report the seasonal trends of phytoplankton primary production (PP) and photosynthesis photoinhibition due to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (I{$\beta$} and UV50). 2. We first collected empirical evidence that indicated the conditions of light limitation persisted during the study period. We found that the depth-averaged irradiance estimated for the time of the day of maximum irradiance (Imean--noon) was always lower than the measured onset of light saturation of photosynthesis (Ik). 3. We then contrasted the observations with theoretical expectations based on a light limitation scenario. The observed temporal patterns of seston concentration, both on a volume and area basis, were significantly explained by I0 (R2 = 0.39 and R2 = 0.37 respectively). The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (kdPAR) (R2 = 0.55) and the depth-averaged irradiance (Imean) (R2 = 0.66), significantly increased with the I0; while the irradiance reaching the lake bottom (Iout) significantly decreased with the incident irradiance (R2 = 0.49). However, phytoplankton biovolume maxima were not coincident with the time of the year of maximum irradiance. 4. A significant positive relationship was observed between PP estimated on an area basis and I0 (R2 = 0.51, P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, the parameters describing the photosynthetic responses to high irradiances displayed marked seasonal trends. The photosynthesis photoinhibition due to PAR as well as to UV were significantly related to incident solar radiation (PAR: R2 = 0.73; UV: R2 = 0.74). These results suggest adaptation of the phytoplankton community in response to changes in incident solar radiation.},

We focused our efforts on single turnover methods, which are most commonly used in phytoplankton research, while recognizing that other approaches, including Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorescence techniques, are also employed with macro-algae, corals and terrestrial plants. Over the past two years, our group has worked to build consensus around best practice for the collection, analysis and archiving of ST-ChlF data from a variety of aquatic environments.  We aim to facilitate wide-spread use of ST-ChlF methods by the international research community, and have thus far focused our work on several key activities outlined in the Working Group's terms of reference.},

  abstract = {Marine picocyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the modern ocean, where they exert a profound influence on elemental cycling and energy flow. The use of transmembrane chlorophyll complexes instead of phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae is considered a defining attribute of Prochlorococcus. Its ecology and evolution are understood in terms of light, temperature, and nutrients. Here, we report single-cell genomic information on previously uncharacterized phylogenetic lineages of this genus from nutrient-rich anoxic waters of the eastern tropical North and South Pacific Ocean. The most basal lineages exhibit optical and genotypic properties of phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria, indicating that the characteristic light-harvesting antenna of the group is not an ancestral attribute. Additionally, we found that all the indigenous lineages analyzed encode genes for pigment biosynthesis under oxygen-limited conditions, a trait shared with other freshwater and coastal marine cyanobacteria. Our findings thus suggest that Prochlorococcus diverged from other cyanobacteria under low-oxygen conditions before transitioning from phycobilisomes to transmembrane chlorophyll complexes and may have contributed to the oxidation of the ancient ocean.}

  abstract = {Vast expanses of oxygen-deficient and nitrite-rich water define the major oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the global ocean. They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ``end points'' represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories, leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to continue well into the future.}

  abstract = {Macroalgal blooms are produced by nutrient enrichment of estuaries in which the sea floor lies within the photic zone. We review features of macroalgal blooms pointed out in recent literature and summarize work done in the Waquoit Bay Land Margin Ecosystems Research project which suggests that nutrient loads, water residence times, presence of fringing salt marshes, and grazing affect macroalgal blooms.                            Increases in nitrogen supply raise macroalgal N uptake rates, N contents of tissues, photosynthesis-irradiance curves and               P               max               and accelerate growth of fronds. The resulting increase in macroalgal biomass is the macroalgal bloom, which can displace other estuarine producers. Fringing marshes and brief water residence impair the intensity of macroalgal blooms. Grazing pressure may control blooms of palatable macroalgae, but only at lower N loading rates. Macroalgal blooms end when growth of the phytoplankton attenuates irradiation reaching the bottom. In estuaries with brief water residence times, phytoplankton may not have enough time to grow and shade macrophytes. High phytoplankton division rates achieved at high nutrient concentrations may compensate for the brief time to divide before cells are transported out of the estuary.                                         Increased N loads and associated macroalgal blooms pervasively and fundamentally alter estuarine ecosystems. Macroalgae intercept nutrients regenerated from sediments and thus uncouple biogeochemical sedimentary cycles from those in the water column. Macroalgae take up so much N that water quality seems high even where N loads are high. Macroalgal C moves more readily through microbial and consumer food webs than C derived from seagrasses that were replaced by macroalgae. Macroalgae dominate O               2               profiles of the water columns of shallow estuaries and thus alter the biogeochemistry of the sediments. More frequent hypoxia and habitat changes associated with macroalgal blooms also changes the abundance of benthic fauna in affected estuaries.                          Approaches to remediation of the many pervasive effects of macroalgal blooms need to include interception of nutrients at their watershed sources and perhaps removal by harvest of macroalgae or by increased flushing. Although we have much knowledge of macroalgal dynamics, all such management initiatives will require additional information.},

We have studied the transcriptional, metabolic and photo-physiological responses to light of different spectral quality in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum through time-series studies of cultures exposed to equal doses of photosynthetically usable radiation of blue, green and red light. The experiments showed that short-term differences in gene expression and profiles are mainly light quality-dependent. Transcription of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes was activated mainly through a light quality-independent mechanism likely to rely on chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. In contrast, genes encoding proteins important for photoprotection and PSII repair were highly dependent on a blue light receptor-mediated signal. Changes in energy transfer efficiency by light-harvesting pigments were spectrally dependent; furthermore, a declining trend in photosynthetic efficiency was observed in red light. The combined results suggest that diatoms possess a light quality-dependent ability to activate photoprotection and efficient repair of photodamaged PSII. In spite of approximately equal numbers of PSII-absorbed quanta in blue, green and red light, the spectral quality of light is important for diatom responses to ambient light conditions.},

It is still poorly understood what limits growth of this organism in batch and continuous cultures in BG-11, the standard medium used to grow Synechocystis. Through a series of batch experiments in flasks and continuous mode experiments in advanced photobioreactors, it is shown that the limiting nutrient during batch cultivation is sulfate, the depletion of which leads to ROS formation and rapid bleaching of pigments after entry into stationary phase. In continuous mode, however, the limiting nutrient is iron. Optimizing these growth conditions resulted in a so far highest growth rate of 0.16 h-1 (4.3 h doubling time), which is significantly higher than the textbook value of 0.09 h-1 (8 h doubling time). An improved medium, BG-11 for prolonged cultivation (BG-11-PC) is introduced, that allows for controlled, extended cultivation of Synechocystis, under well-defined physiological conditions.

Fluorescence microscopy cell counts showed that picocyanobacteria occurred in high concentrations (103 to 2.5 {\texttimes} 104 cells{$\cdot$}ml-1) in the oxic and suboxic zones of all of these waters. Molecular analysis of the 16S rRNA gene using Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of samples from 8 different lakes and fjords revealed a low diversity of picocyanobacteria affiliated to the genus Synechococcus. In total, 132 short sequences from DGGE bands, clones and strains were obtained. Most of the sequences (83 \%) clustered in two closely related groups that tend to separate according to saline or freshwater conditions. However, some representatives of each OTU were found in different types of habitat, suggesting some degree of tolerance. These results show that picocyanobacteria are widely distributed under a broad range of physical and chemical conditions in the Arctic environment, and that some genotypes may be specialists that occupy specific habitat types},

  abstract = {Light induced damage of the photosynthetic apparatus is an important and highly complex phenomenon, which affects primarily the Photosystem II complex. Here the author summarizes the current state of understanding of the molecular mechanisms, which are involved in the light induced inactivation of Photosystem II electron transport together with the relevant mechanisms of photoprotection. Short wavelength ultraviolet radiation impairs primarily the Mn4Ca catalytic site of the water oxidizing complex with additional effects on the quinone electron acceptors and tyrosine donors of PSII. The main mechanism of photodamage by visible light appears to be mediated by acceptor side modifications, which develop under conditions of excess excitation in which the capacity of light-independent photosynthetic processes limits the utilization of electrons produced in the initial photoreactions. This situation of excess excitation facilitates the reduction of intersystem electron carriers and Photosystem II acceptors, and thereby induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, especially singlet oxygen whose production is sensitized by triplet chlorophyll formation in the reaction center of Photosystem II. The highly reactive singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2 and O2-, which can also be formed in Photosystem II initiate damage of electron transport components and protein structure. In parallel with the excess excitation dependent mechanism of photodamage inactivation of the Mn4Ca cluster by visible light may also occur, which impairs electron transfer through the Photosystem II complex and initiates further functional and structural damage of the reaction center via formation of highly oxidizing radicals, such as P680+ and Tyr-Z+. However, the available data do not support the hypothesis that the Mn-dependent mechanism would be the exclusive or dominating pathway of photodamage in the visible spectral range.

Taxonomic pigments were used as size class markers of phototroph groups (picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton). Primary production rates were computed using a light photosynthesis model that makes use of the total chlorophyll a (Tchl a) concentration profile as an input variable. New production was estimated as the product of primary production by a pigment-based proxy of the {\textflorin} ratio (new production/total production). For the whole eastern Mediterranean, Tchl a concentration was 20.4 mg m-2, and estimated primary and new production were 0.27 and 0.04 g C m-2 d-1, respectively, when integrated between the surface and the depth of the productive zone (1.5 times the euphotic layer). Nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton (determined from the pigment-derived criteria) were the dominant size classes and contributed to 60 and 27\%, respectively, of Tchl a, while microphytoplankton contributed only to 13\%. Subbasin and, to a certain extent, mesoscale structures (cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres) were exceptions to this general trend. Anticyclonic gyres were characterized by low Tchl a concentrations (18.8{\textpm}4.2 mg m-2, with the lowest value being 12.4 mg m-2) and the highest picophytoplankton contribution (40\% of Tchl a). In contrast, cyclonic gyres contained the highest Tchl a concentration (40.3{\textpm}15.3 mg m-2) with the highest microphytoplankton contribution (up to 26\% of Tchl a). Observations conducted at a mesoscale in the Rhode gyre (cyclonic) region show that the core of the gyre is dominated by microphytoplankton (mainly diatoms), while adjacent areas are characterized by high chlorophyll concentration dominated by picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton. We estimate that the Rhodes gyre is a zone of enhanced new production, which is 9 times higher than that in adjacent oligotrophic areas of the Levantine basin. Our results confirm the predominance of oligotrophic conditions in the eastern Mediterranean and emphasize the role of subbasin and mesoscale dynamics in driving phytoplankton biomass and composition and, finally, biogeochemical cycling in this area.},

The chlorophyll a concentrations ranged between 0.2 and 390 {$\mu$}g 1-1. No simple relation existed between trophic state and the abundance of picocyanobacterial, mainly represented by Synechococcus spp. Below 10 {$\mu$}g Chl a 1-1 the percentage contribution of picocyanobacteria biomass to total phytoplankton biomass exceeded 70\% in some cases, whereas above 100 {$\mu$}g Chl a l-1, the highest contribution was only 10\%.

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms have developed multiple protective mechanisms to survive under high-light conditions. In plants, one of these mechanisms is the thermal dissipation of excitation energy in the membrane-bound chlorophyll antenna of photosystem II. The question of whether or not cyanobacteria, the progenitor of the chloroplast, have an equivalent photoprotective mechanism has long been unanswered. Recently, however, evidence was presented for the possible existence of a mechanism dissipating excess absorbed energy in the phycobilisome, the extramembrane antenna of cyanobacteria. Here, we demonstrate that this photoprotective mechanism, characterized by blue light--induced fluorescence quenching, is indeed phycobilisome-related and that a soluble carotenoid binding protein, ORANGE CAROTENOID PROTEIN (OCP), encoded by the slr1963 gene in Synechocystis PCC 6803, plays an essential role in this process. Blue light is unable to quench fluorescence in the absence of phycobilisomes or OCP. The fluorescence quenching is not {$\Delta$}pH-dependent, and it can be induced in the absence of the reaction center II or the chlorophyll antenna, CP43 and CP47. Our data suggest that OCP, which strongly interacts with the thylakoids, acts as both the photoreceptor and the mediator of the reduction of the amount of energy transferred from the phycobilisomes to the photosystems. These are novel roles for a soluble carotenoid protein.}

  abstract = {Phytoplankton are at the base of aquatic food webs and of global importance for ecosystem functioning and services. The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect  various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Environmental toxicology focuses on identifying and predicting impact of potentially toxic anthropogenic chemicals on biosphere at various levels of biological organization. Presently there is a significant drive to gain deeper understanding of cellular and sub-cellular mechanisms of ecotoxicity. Most notable is increased focus on elucidation of cellular-response networks, interactomes, and greater implementation of cell-based biotests using high-throughput procedures, while at the same time decreasing the reliance on standard animal models used in ecotoxicity testing. This is aimed at discovery and interpretation of molecular pathways of ecotoxicity at large scale. In this regard, the applications of cytometry are perhaps one of the most fundamental prospective analytical tools for the next generation and high-throughput ecotoxicology research. The diversity of this modern technology spans flow, laser-scanning, imaging, and more recently, Raman as well as mass cytometry. The cornerstone advantages of cytometry include the possibility of multi-parameter measurements, gating and rapid analysis. Cytometry overcomes, thus, limitations of traditional bulk techniques such as spectrophotometry or gel-based techniques that average the results from pooled cell populations or small model organisms. Novel technologies such as cell imaging in flow, laser scanning cytometry, as well as mass cytometry provide innovative and tremendously powerful capabilities to analyze cells, tissues as well as to perform in situ analysis of small model organisms. In this review, we outline cytometry as a tremendously diverse field that is still vastly underutilized and often largely unknown in environmental sciences. The main motivation of this work is to highlight the potential and wide-reaching applications of cytometry in ecotoxicology, guide environmental scientists in the technological aspects as well as popularize its broader adoption in environmental risk assessment.},

  abstract = {It is commonly known that phytoplankton have a pivotal role in marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems as carbon fixers and oxygen producers, but their response to deoxygenation has scarcely been studied. Nonetheless, in the major oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), all surface phytoplankton groups, regardless of size, disappear and are replaced by unique cyanobacteria lineages below the oxycline. To develop reasonable hypotheses to explain this pattern, we conduct a review of available information on OMZ phytoplankton, and we re-analyze previously published data (flow cytometric and hydrographic) on vertical structure of phytoplankton communities in relation to light and O2 levels. We also review the physical constraints on O2 acquisition as well as O2-dependent metabolisms in phototrophs. These considerations, along with estimates of the photosynthetic capacity of phytoplankton along OMZ depth profiles using published data, suggest that top-down grazing, respiratory demand, and irradiance are insufficient to fully explain the vertical structure observed in the upper, more sunlit portions of OMZs. Photorespiration and water--water cycles are O2-dependent pathways with low O2 affinities. Although their metabolic roles are still poorly understood, a hypothetical dependence on such pathways by the phytoplankton adapted to the oxic ocean might explain vertical patterns in OMZs and results of laboratory experiments. This can be represented in a simple model in which the requirement for photorespiration in surface phytoplankton and O2-inhibition of OMZ lineages reproduces the observed vertical fluorescence profiles and the replacement of phytoplankton adapted to O2 by lineages restricted to the most O2-deficient waters. A high O2 requirement by modern phytoplankton would suggest a positive feedback that intensifies trends in OMZ extent and ocean oxygenation or deoxygenation, both in Earth's past and in response to current climate change.},

The retrieved PFTs include diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, green algae and prokaryotic phytoplankton. A previously proposed method to retrieve various phytoplankton pigments, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), is investigated and adapted to retrieve Chl-a concentrations of multiple PFTs using extensive global data sets of in situ pigment measurements and matchups with satellite OC products. The performance of the EOF-based approach is assessed and cross-validated statistically. The retrieved PFTs are compared with those derived from diagnostic pigment analysis (DPA) based on in situ pigment measurements. Results show that the approach predicts well Chl-a concentrations of most of the mentioned PFTs. The performance of the approach is, however, less accurate for prokaryotes, possibly due to their general low variability and small concentration range resulting in a weak signal which is extracted from the reflectance data and corresponding EOF modes. As a demonstration of the approach utilization, the EOF-based fitted models based on satellite reflectance products at nine bands are applied to the monthly GlobColour merged products. Climatological characteristics of the PFTs are also evaluated based on ten years of merged products (2002-2012) through inter-comparisons with other existing satellite derived products on phytoplankton composition including phytoplankton size class (PSC), SynSenPFT, OC-PFT and PHYSAT. Inter-comparisons indicate that most PFTs retrieved by our study agree well with previous corresponding PFT/PSC products, except that prokaryotes show higher Chl-a concentration in low latitudes. PFT dominance derived from our products is in general well consistent with the PHYSAT product. A preliminary experiment of the retrieval algorithm using eleven OLCI bands is applied to monthly OLCI products, showing comparable PFT distributions with those from the merged products, though the matchup data for OLCI are limited both in number and coverage. This study is to ultimately deliver satellite global PFT products for long-term continuous observation, which will be updated timely with upcoming OC data, for a comprehensive understanding of the variability of phytoplankton composition structure at a global or regional scale.},

The fitting coefficient {$\rho$} measures excitation transfer from closed PSII to remaining open PSII upon illumination, which could theoretically generate a progressive increase in {$\sigma$}PSII for the remaining open PSII. To investigate how {$\rho$} responds to illumination we grew marine phytoplankters with diverse antenna structures (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira pseudonana) under limiting or saturating growth light. Initial {$\rho$} varied with growth light in Synechococcus and Thalassiosira. With increasing actinic illumination PSII closed progressively and {$\rho$} decreased for all four taxa, in a pattern explicable as an exponential decay of {$\rho$} with increasing distance between remaining open PSII reaction centers. This light-dependent down-regulation of {$\rho$} allows the four phytoplankters to limit the effect of increasing light upon {$\sigma$}PSII. The four structurally distinct taxa showed, however, distinct rates of response of {$\rho$} to PSII closure, likely reflecting differences in the spacing or orientation among their PSII centers. Following saturating illumination recovery of {$\rho$} in darkness coincided directly with PSII re-opening in Prochlorococcus. Even after PSII had re-opened in Synechococcus a transition to State II slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Ostreococcus sustained NPQ slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Thalassiosira dark recovery of {$\rho$} was slowed, possibly by a light-induced change in PSII spacing. These patterns of {$\rho$} versus PSII closure are thus a convenient probe of comparative PSII spacings.},

Phytoplankters regulate {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$} to mitigate over- or under-excitation of Photosystem II. We used diverse phytoplankton taxa to compare short term changes in {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$} with the induction of the yield of non-photochemical quenching (YNPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence, a measure of regulated excitation dissipation. In two picocyanobacteria {$\sigma$}PSII' showed no decline upon induction of moderate YNPQ, above light levels sufficient for saturation of electron transport. In the eukaryotic chl a/b Ostreococcus and the chl a/c diatom Thalassiosira, induction of non-photochemical quenching was stronger after growth under saturating light, an acclimation attributable to increased xanthophyll cycle pigment content. Across short and longer-term light histories to induce or relax regulatory processes Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira showed proportional variations between the level of YNPQ and the down regulation of {$\sigma$}PSII'. The proportional down regulation of {$\sigma$}PSII' was, however, significantly smaller than the amplitude of YNPQ induction. For the eukaryotes we can predict changes in {$\sigma$}PSII', useful for modelling electron transport, productivity and acclimation, from measures of YNPQ, which are accessible from fluorescence yield measures that do not include {$\sigma$}PSII{$\prime$}. This useful relation, however, does not extend to the tested prokaryotes, possibly as a result of differential violations of the rate constant assumptions that underlie the calculated YNPQ parameter.},

The maximum reached growth rate was 0.135 h-1, which corresponds to a doubling time of 5.13 h---a growth speed never reported for Synechocystis before. Saturating red light intensity for the strain was 220--360 {$\mu$}mol(photons) m-2 s-1, and we did not observe any photoinhibition up to 660 {$\mu$}mol(photons) m-2 s-1. Synechocystis was able to grow under red light only; however, photons of wavelengths 405--585 and 670--700 nm further improved its growth. Optimal growth temperature was 35{$^\circ$}C. Below 32{$^\circ$}C, the growth rates decreased linearly with temperature coefficient (Q10) 1.70. Semicontinuous cultivation is known to be efficient for growth characterization and optimization. However, the assumption of correct growth rates calculation---culture exponential growth---is often not fulfilled. The semicontinuous setup in this study was operated as a turbidostat. Accurate online OD measurements with high time-resolution allowed fast and reliable growth rates determination. Repeating diluting frequencies (up to 18 dilutions per day) were essential for rapid growth stability evaluation. The presented setup provides improvement to previously published semicontinuous characterization strategies by decreasing experimental time requirements and maintaining the culture in exponential growth phase throughout the entire characterization procedure.},

Investigations of picophytoplankton in the central Arctic Ocean region are rare because these waters used to be completely covered with sea ice. Large, newly exposed water areas, however, appeared in the sea ice zone during the summer of 2010. This provided the first opportunity to study the Arctic picophytoplankton community in these newly open surface waters. This study focuses on the picophytoplankton in the areas near the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge and  Makarov Basin. Here, HPLC pigment analysis with CHEMTAX was used to study community populations, and 454 pyrosequencing with bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the dominant genera (species). Both Pearson correlation analysis and canonical correlation analysis were used to study the relationships between the community and environmental factors. We found chlorophyll a concentrations were low (0.05--0.39~{$\mu$}g~l-1), and picophytoplankton dominated these areas. The abundances of picophytoplankton were 1.58~{\texttimes}~106--9.47~{\texttimes}~106~cells~l-1 and made up 44--80~\% of the total chlorophyll a.

Growth effects of temperature and irradiance were evident in most algae tested, and there were significant interactions among treatments. Most freshwater red algae had the best growth under low irradiance, confirming the preference of freshwater red algae for low light regimens. In general there was highest growth rate in long days and low irradiance. Growth optima in relation to temperature were species-specific and also varied between low and high irradiances for the same alga. The most significant differences in pigment content were related to temperature, whereas few significant differences could be attributed to variation in irradiance and photoperiod or interactions among the three parameters. The responses were species-specific and also differed for pigments in distinct temperatures, irradiances and photoperiods in the same alga. Phycocyanin was generally more concentrated than phycoerythrin and phycobiliproteins were more concentrated than chlorophyll a. The highest total pigment contents were found in two species typical of shaded habitats: A. hermannii and C. coeruleus.
