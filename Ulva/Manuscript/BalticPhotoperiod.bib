  abstract = {Cluster 5 picocyanobacteria significantly contribute to primary productivity in aquatic ecosystems. Estuarine populations are highly diverse and consist of many co-occurring strains, but their physiology remains largely understudied. In this study, we characterized 17 novel estuarine picocyanobacterial strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA and pigment genes (cpcB and cpeBA) uncovered multiple estuarine and freshwater-related clusters and pigment types. Assays with five representative strains (three phycocyanin rich and two phycoerythrin rich) under temperature (10--30{$^\circ$}C), light (10--190 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1), and salinity (2--14 PSU) gradients revealed distinct growth optima and tolerance, indicating that genetic variability was accompanied by physiological diversity. Adaptability to environmental conditions was associated with differential pigment content and photosynthetic performance. Amplicon sequence variants at a coastal and an offshore station linked population dynamics with phylogenetic clusters, supporting that strains isolated in this study represent key ecotypes within the Baltic Sea picocyanobacterial community. The functional diversity found within strains with the same pigment type suggests that understanding estuarine picocyanobacterial ecology requires analysis beyond the phycocyanin and phycoerythrin divide. This new knowledge of the environmental preferences in estuarine picocyanobacteria is important for understanding and evaluating productivity in current and future ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many cyanobacteria fix atmospheric N2 only in specialised cells called heterocysts1,2. Besides containing nitrogenase2, heterocysts are distinguished biochemically from vegetative cells by their inability to evolve O2 or to perform photosystem II activities1,3,4and by a deficiency in the CO2 fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase5. These cells also lack phycobiliproteins and phycobilisomes, that are part of the major light-collecting system for the light reactions of photosynthesis1,6. The phycobilipigments, light-collecting chlorophyll a and the photochemical reaction centres constitute a photosynthetic unit (PSU)---the minimum number of pigments necessary to drive photochemistry, oxygen evolution and photosynthetic electron transport. Therefore, the PSU represents an energy generating unit. In cyanobacteria, photosynthesis, and hence the PSU, contributes both ATP and probably a strong reductant to drive nitrogen fixation8. Because of the distinct photosynthetic properties of these cells, especially in pigmentation, we have compared the functional organisation of the pigments and photochemical activity of the thylakoid membranes from vegetative and heterocyst cells of Nostoc muscorum and Anabaena cylindrica. We demonstrate that the PSU is modified during the differentiation of heterocysts to support the specialised energetic requirements of these nitrogen fixing cells.},

If there is interaction between two factors model of observations include interaction term and is called 'non-additive model' which makes interaction and non-additivity equivalent in terms of meaning. When there are several observations taken at each level combination of two variables, testing non-additivity can easily be done by usual two-way ANOVA method which cannot be used when there is only one observation per cell. For the cases with only one observation per cell, some methods have been developed starting with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test in which interaction is supposed to be the product of two factor's effects. There are other methods which are used for different structures of interaction when there is only one observation. In this paper, we review some of these tests. After presenting general methodology for the two-factor linear model with interaction effect and the general two-way ANOVA method when there are n {$>$} 1 observations per cell, we present some methods for testing non-additivity when there is only one observation per cell. Finally, we illustrate these methods on examples.},

Satellite capability to detect diurnal changes in ocean color was characterized using hourly overlapping afternoon orbits of the visual infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership ocean color sensor and validated with in situ observations. The monthly cycle of diurnal changes was investigated for different water masses using VIIRS overlaps. Results showed the capability of satellite observations to monitor hourly color changes in coastal regions that can be impacted by vertical movement of optical layers, in response to tides, resuspension, and river plume dispersion. The spatial variability of VIIRS diurnal changes showed the occurrence and displacement of phytoplankton blooming and decaying processes. The diurnal change in ocean color was above 20\%, which represents a 30\% change in chlorophyll-a. Seasonal changes in diurnal ocean color for different water masses suggest differences in summer and winter responses to surface processes. The diurnal changes observed using satellite ocean color can be used to define the following: surface processes associated with biological activity, vertical changes in optical depth, and advection of water masses.}

Thriving ice algal communities, generally dominated by diatoms, live at the ice/water interface and in recently flooded surface and interior layers, especially during spring, when temperatures begin to rise. Although protists dominate the sea ice biomass, heterotrophic bacteria are also abundant. The sea ice ecosystem provides food for a host of animals, with crustaceans being the most conspicuous. Uneaten organic matter from the ice sinks through the water column and feeds benthic ecosystems. As sea ice extent declines, ice algae likely contribute a shrinking fraction of the total amount of organic matter produced in polar waters.},

The results of these studies are increasing our understanding of the biosynthetic enzyme reaction mechanisms, the physical properties of the enzymes, modes of metabolic regulation, the evolution of the pathway, and the phylogenetic relationships among cyanobacteria, other bacteria, algae, and plants. In this article, emphasis is placed on the individual enzymatic steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, the natures of substrates, reaction intermediates, and products, the physical, kinetic, and regulatory properties of the enzymes, and the identification of genes that encode the enzymes. Because of the limited amount of available information that has been directly derived from cyanobacteria, results obtained from other organisms is discussed wherever it is likely to be applicable to cyanobacteria.},

Most strikingly, red-illuminated cultures contain no measurable C-phycoerythrin and have a mean filament length about 10 times shorter than fluorescent-illuminated cultures. C-phycoerythrin behaves as a photoinducible constituent of this alga. Spectrophotometric and immunochemical procedures were devised so that C-phycoerythrin metabolism could be studied quantitatively with [14C]-phenylalanine pulse-chased cultures. Transfer of red-illuminated cultures to fluorescent light initiates C-phycoerythrin production by essentially de novo synthesis. C-phycoerythrin is not degraded to any significant extent in cultures continuously illuminated with fluorescent light. Transfer of fluorescent-illuminated cultures to red light causes an abrupt cessation of C-phycoerythrin synthesis. The C-phycoerythrin content of cultures adapting to red light decreases and subsequently becomes constant. Loss of C-phycoerythrin is not brought about by metabolic degradation, but rather by a decrease in mean filament length which is effected by transcellular breakage. In this experimental system, light influences intracellular C-phycoerythrin levels by regulating the rate of synthesis of the chromoprotein.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer reactions among colored cytochromes in intact bacterial cells were monitored using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted the acquisition of accurate absorbance data in suspensions of cells that scatter light. The aerobic iron respiratory chain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was dominated by the redox status of an abundant cellular cytochrome that had an absorbance peak at 579\,nm in the reduced state. Intracellular cytochrome 579 was reduced within the time that it took to mix a suspension of the bacteria with soluble ferrous iron at pH 1.7. Steady state turnover experiments were conducted where the initial concentrations of ferrous iron were less than or equal to that of the oxygen concentration. Under these conditions, the initial absorbance spectrum of the bacterium observed under air-oxidized conditions was always regenerated from that of the bacterium observed in the presence of Fe(II). The kinetics of aerobic respiration on soluble iron by intact L. ferrooxidans conformed to the Michaelis--Menten formalism, where the reduced intracellular cytochrome 579 represented the Michaelis complex whose subsequent oxidation appeared to be the rate-limiting step in the overall aerobic respiratory process. The velocity of formation of ferric iron at any time point was directly proportional to the concentration of the reduced cytochrome 579. Further, the integral over time of the concentration of the reduced cytochrome was directly proportional to the total concentration of ferrous iron in each reaction mixture. These kinetic data obtained using whole cells were consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cytochrome 579 is an obligatory steady state intermediate in the iron respiratory chain of this bacterium. The capability of conducting visible spectroscopy in suspensions of intact cells comprises a powerful post-reductionist means to study cellular respiration in situ under physiological conditions for the organism.},

This scientific roadmap identifies user needs, summarizes the current state of the art, and pinpoints major gaps in long-term objectives to deliver space-derived phytoplankton diversity data that meets the user requirements. These major gaps in using ocean color to estimate phytoplankton community structure were identified as: (a) the mismatch between satellite, in situ and model data on phytoplankton composition, (b) the lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates provided with satellite data, (c) the spectral limitation of current sensors to enable the full exploitation of backscattered sunlight, and (d) the very limited applicability of satellite algorithms determining phytoplankton composition for regional, especially coastal or inland, waters. Recommendation for actions include but are not limited to: (i) an increased communication and round-robin exercises among and within the related expert groups, (ii) the launching of higher spectrally and spatially resolved sensors, (iii) the development of algorithms that exploit hyperspectral information, and of (iv) techniques to merge and synergistically use the various streams of continuous information on phytoplankton diversity from various satellite sensors' and in situ data to ensure long-term monitoring of phytoplankton composition.},

Intriguingly, a novel bloom was detected in winter 2015--2016, in which picocyanobacterial cell density increased by one order of magnitude despite lower water temperature, suggesting the possibility that ``cold-water-preference'' species dominate in the picocyanobacterial community. In the present study, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of picocyanobacteria in Lake Biwa by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. We found that the picocyanobacterial community were highly diverse in Lake Biwa, with eight Synechococcus-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in different seasons. These OTUs fell into distinct phylogenetic groups, and the majority were closely related to clusters reported previously. Notably, OTU04, detected during the winter bloom, was highly affiliated with sequences found in a variety of lakes, such as Tibetan lakes and Lake Superior, where the water bodies generally have a low trophic state and temperature, and different concentrations of total dissolved solids. Thus, we inferred that the group containing OTU04 may be a psychrotolerant lineage that is widely distributed in oligotrophic water systems with low--intermediate salinity.},

Yet, it was only recently, and thanks to developments in molecular biology and in the understanding of gene sequences and genomes, that we could shed light on the depth of the connection between their evolution and the history of life on the planet. Here, we briefly review the current understanding of these small prokaryotic cells, from their physiological features to their role and dynamics in different aquatic environments, focussing particularly on the still poorly understood ability of picocyanobacteria to adapt to dark conditions. While the recent discovery of Synechococcus strains able to survive in the deep Black Sea highlights how adaptable picocyanobacteria can be, it also raises more questions---showing how much we still do not know about microbial life. Using available information from brackish Black Sea strains able to perform and survive in dark (anoxic) conditions, we illustrate how adaptation to narrow ecological niches interacts with gene evolution and metabolic capacity.},

Synechococcus, the focus of this review, is one of the prevalent genera in the order Chroococcales, common in oceans and lakes and characterized by a coccoid unicellular or microcolony morphology. The evolution of its phycobilisomes is the key of the adaptation of this tiny photosynthetic cell to different light regimes and environmental conditions. Furthermore, Synechococcus strains are widely distributed from the equator to the poles, showing an extreme adaptability to high and low temperatures. Because of their structural plasticity and ecological adaptability, these cyanobacteria are particularly interesting in the current condition of fast climate change. Moreover, picocyanobacteria of the Synechococcus genus have a potentially vast impact on global cycles thanks to their significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems. As increasing abundances are predicted for this genus worldwide, and in light of the connection between cyanobacteria and global change events, a better characterization of these organisms promises important and timely ecological insights.

Three cell populations were discriminated by flow cytometry: Prochlorococcus prochlorophytes, Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryotes. Prochlorococcus were the most abundant component (maximum ca 2 {\texttimes} 105 cells ml-1). Unlike previous reports, their concentration was almost constant down to roughly 100 m, with a slight maximum at the surface or near the chlorophyll maximum. Cellular chlorophyll fluorescence increased 50-fold between surface and deep populations. One distinguishing feature of the community off Hawaii was the co-occurrence near the chlorophyll maximum of at least two distinct Prochlorococcus populations with different chlorophyll and DNA contents. Throughout the year, Synechococcus abundance was two orders of magnitude lower and there was no seasonal alteration between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as observed in the northern Sargasso Sea. Synechococcus populations did not extend below 120 m and were dominated by high phycourobilin cell types. Picoeukaryote abundance was quite similar to that of Synechococcus, but these cells extended deeper in the water column. Their chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited much less depth variation than Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. Seasonal variability was small ({$<$}2- to 3-fold) for all three components of the picoplankton, not only for cell abundance but also for cellular parameters such as light scatter or pigment fluorescence. Synechococcus populations exhibited the largest seasonal changes (e.g. abundance maximum and chlorophyll fluorescence varied 3-fold). Picoplankton community structure in the Pacific Ocean appears to be distinct from previous reports for other areas. In comparing station ALOHA to the Atlantic Ocean (especially the Sargasso Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea, depth-integrated abundances of Prochlorococcus were higher, that of Synechococcus were lower, and that of picoeukaryotes were similar. We believe this structure, dominated by Prochlorococcus, may be typical for subtropical open-ocean regions.},

  abstract = {The cyanobacteria are a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms that carry out oxygenic photosynthesis and are thought to be responsible for the oxygenation of our atmosphere. Like red algae and cryptomonads, cyanobacteria also contain phycobiliproteins (PBPs) which serve as major accessory pigments during photosynthesis. PBPs are large water-soluble supramolecular protein aggregates involved in light harvesting and can be divided broadly into three classes, viz., phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC), and allophycocyanin (APC) based on their spectral properties. PBPs have been extracted and purified from Spirulina spp., Synechococcus sp., Oscillatoria sp., etc., and produced commercially from Spirulina platensis, Anabaena sp., and Galdieria sulphuraria. Since cyanobacteria exhibit wide variations in nutrient availability, light intensity, light quality (wavelength), temperature, water activity, etc., these variations also result in altered metabolic activity of these organisms as a result of differential expression of different genes. The expression of phycobiliprotein coding genes is also accordingly modulated to adapt to a particular condition. Many workers have reported changes in phycobilisome structure and expression of cpc genes in response to light quality, light quantity, and nutrients like nitrogen, sulfur, etc. The composition and function of phycobiliproteins in cyanobacteria have also been reported to change under stress conditions. In the present paper, we have reviewed the production, purification, and regulation of cyanobacterial phycobilins including their importance in the commercial sector, as they have several applications as natural dyes in food and cosmetic industry, immunological assays, health-promoting properties, and broad range of other pharmaceutical applications.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous oceanographic features that influence the metabolism and community structure of Synechococcus. However, the metabolic adaptations of this genus to eddy-associated environmental changes have rarely been studied. We recovered two high-quality Synechococcus metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from eddies in the South China Sea and compared their metabolic variations using metatranscriptomic samples obtained at the same time. The two MAGs (syn-bin1 and syn-bin2) are affiliated with marine Synechococcus subclusters 5.2 (S5.2) and 5.3 (S5.3), respectively. The former exhibited a higher abundance at the surface layer, whereas the latter was more abundant in the deep euphotic layer. Further analysis indicated that syn-bin1 had a strong ability to utilize organic nutrients, which could help it to thrive in the nutrient-deprived surface water. By contrast, syn-bin2 had the genetic potential to perform chromatic acclimation, which could allow it to capture green or blue light at different depths. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis showed that syn-bin2 upregulated genes involved in the synthesis of C4 acids, photosystem II proteins, and transporters in the deep euphotic layer, which might contribute to its predominance in low-light environments. Overall, this study expands our understanding of oceanic S5.2 and S5.3 Synechococcus by revealing their metabolic adaptations to mesoscale eddies.},

For example, Synechococcus is restricted to the first 100 m, whereas Prochlorococcus extends much deeper in oligotrophic waters. This is in part explained by differences in adaptation to nutrient and light regimes. However, they could also be subjected to different predation rates. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the consumption of these two picoplankters by an algivorous ciliate, Strombidium sulcatum, and a bactivorous ciliate, Uronema sp. For both ciliate species, removal rates were higher, by a factor of 3 to 10, for Synechococcus compared to Prochlorococcus when prey items were presented alone or together. The growth of the two ciliates fed Synechococcus and/or Prochlorococcus also differed. S. sulcatum grew well on both prey items, whether alone or together, whereas Uronema sp. grew slowly when fed Synechococcus and very poorly when fed Prochlorococcus either alone or with Synechococcus. Our results suggest that Prochlorococcus may be less subject to ciliate predation than Synechococcus.},

The 10-fold increase in the chlorophyll a concentration (from 0.4 to 4.0 mg/m3) during a diatom/ dinoflagellate bloom leads to a decrease in water transparency and a narrowing of the photosynthesis zone. As a consequence, the average PAR within the phytoplankton habitat layer is almost halved. A diatom/dinoflagellate bloom is accompanied by changes in the downwelling irradiance spectrum at the same PAR level (optical depths). The penetrating irradiance maximum near the bottom of the euphotic zone shifts to longer wavelengths ({\textasciitilde}550--600 nm) as compared to background conditions ({\textasciitilde}500--550 nm). The increase in diatom/dinoflagellate biomass and the concomitant change in the downwelling irradiance spectrum are accompanied by a decrease in the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigments up to about three times that under background conditions at the same optical depths. The downwelling irradiance spectrum at fixed optical depths and the ability of cells to absorb light change slightly as compared to background conditions when coccolithophores bloom.},

  abstract = {The large, sparse arrays of species counts arising in both field and experimental community studies do not lend themselves to standard statistical tests based on multivariate normality. Instead, a valid and more revealing approach uses informal display methods, such as clustering or multi-dimensional scaling ordination (MDS), based on a biologically-motivated definition of pairwise similarity of samples in terms of species composition. Formal testing methods are still required, however, to establish that real assemblage differences exist between sites, times, experimental treatments, pollution states, etc. Earlier work has described a range of Manteltype permutation or randomisation procedures, making no distributional assumptions, which are termed ANOSIM tests because of their dependence only on (rank) similarities and the analogy to one and two-way ANOVA. This paper extends these tests to cover an important practical case, previously unconsidered, that of a two-way layoutwithout replication. Such cases arise for single samples (or pseudo-replicates) taken in a baseline monitoring survey of several sites over time, or a mesocosm experiment in which ``treatments'' are replicated only once within each experimental ``block''. Significance tests are given for the overall presence of a treatment (or time) effect, based on a measure of concordance between rank similarities of samples within each block (or site); the role of the two factors can be reversed to obtain a test for block effects. As in the analogous univariate ANOVA test, the method relies on absence or relative weakness of treatment x block ``interactions''. Its scope is illustrated with data from two experimental and two field studies, involving meiofaunal communities from soft-sediment and macro-algal habitats. It is seen also to accommodate a modest derree of missing data. Whilst the failure to replicate adequately is not encouraged---a richer inference is available with genuine replication---the paper does provide a limited way forward for hypothesis testing in the absence of replicates.},

Only near-surface observations are common to both remote sensing and in situ observation, so it is critical to understand processes in the upper euphotic zone. Unfortunately, the biological principles that must be used to interpret optical variability near the sea surface are weaker than we would like, because relatively few experiments and analyses have examined bio-optical relationships under high irradiance characteristic of the upper optical depth. Special consideration of this stratum is justified, because there is good evidence that bio-optical relationships are altered near the surface: (1) the fluorescence yield from chlorophyll declines, leading to bias in the estimation of pigment from fluorometry; (2) the modeled relationship between solar-stimulated fluorescence and photosynthesis seems to deviate significantly from that presented for the lower euphotic zone; and (3) carbon-specific and cellular attenuation cross sections of phytoplankton change substantially during exposures to bright light. Even the measurement of primary productivity is problematic near the sea surface, because vertical mixing is not simulated and artifactual inhibition of photosynthesis can result. These problems can be addressed by focusing more sampling effort, experimental simulation, and analytical consideration on the upper optical depth and by shortening timescales for the measurement of marine photosynthesis. Special efforts to study near-surface processes are justified, because new bio-optical algorithms will require quantitative descriptions of the responses of phytoplankton to bright light.},

  abstract = {The element nitrogen (N) constitutes about 5--10\% of the dry weight of a cyanobacterial cell. The purpose of this chapter is to review the assimilatory pathways which in free-living cyanobacteria lead from different extracellular N-sources to cellular N-containing components. Inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium is incorporated into glutamine and glutamate via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle. The glnA gene, encoding glutamine synthetase, has been characterized in a number of cyanobacteria. Glutamate (and glutamine) distribute N to other organic compounds by means of transaminases, and glutamate is itself a precursor of some other nitrogenous metabolites. Ammonium can be taken up from the external medium by the cyanobacterial cell, but it can also be derived from other nutrients, essentially N2, nitrate and urea. Many cyanobacteria are able to fix N2 under aerobic conditions. Strategies for protecting nitrogenase from O2 in cyanobacteria include the temporal separation of nitrogenase activity and photosynthetic O2 evolution, and in some filamentous cyanobacteria, the differentiation of heterocysts (cells specialized in N2 fixation). A detailed characterization of nif genes has only been performed in a heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium. Nitrate reduction has been found to use photosynthetically reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor, and genes encoding nitrate transport and reduction proteins have been identified and shown to constitute an operon. Some amino acids like arginine and glutamine can also contribute N to some cyanobacteria; however, urea and amino acid utilization have been poorly investigated thus far. Pathways of N assimilation in cyanobacteria are induced upon ammonium deprivation, ammonium being the preferred N source. A gene, ntcA, encoding a transcriptional regulator required for expression of proteins subjected to nitrogen control has been identified. A major theme for future research is how information about the N status of the cell is sensed and transduced to the protein(s) effecting regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {When deprived of essential nutrients, the non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 undergoes a proteolytic degradation of the phycobiliproteins, its major light-harvesting pigments. This process is known as chlorosis. This paper presents evidence that the degradation of phycobiliproteins is part of an acclimation process in which growing cells differentiate into non-pigmented cells able to endure long periods of starvation. The time course of degradation processes differs for various photosynthetic pigments, for photosystem I and photosystem II activities and is strongly influenced by the illumination and by the experimental conditions of nutrient deprivation. Under standard experimental conditions of combined nitrogen deprivation, three phases of the differentiation process can be defined. The first phase corresponds to the well-known phycobiliprotein degradation, in phase 2 the cells lose chlorophyll a prior to entering phase 3, the fully differentiated state, in which the cells are still able to regenerate pigmentation after the addition of nitrate to the culture. An analysis of the protein synthesis patterns by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis during nitrogen starvation indicates extensive differential gene expression, suggesting the operation of tight regulatory mechanisms.},

In early summer, the abundance of picocyanobacteria was related to water masses: they were nearly absent in polar water, whereas they occurred in high concentrations (up to 5470 cells ml-1) in Atlantic Water. During autumn and beginning of winter, the abundances of picocyanobacteria remained around 103 cells ml-1. Their relative contribution to total picoplanktonic algal abundance increased from 0\% during spring/summer to 70--80\% in late autumn, as a result of a decrease in the abundance of eucaryotic picoalgae. Consequently, the impact of picocyanobacteria on Arctic epipelagic carbon and energy flow is of minor importance, and the strong contribution of picoplankton algae to biomass and primary productivity in Arctic seas has to be attributed to eucaryotic species.},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria are major contributors to global oceanic primary production and exhibit a unique diversity of photosynthetic pigments, allowing them to exploit a wide range of light niches. However, the relationship between pigment content and niche partitioning has remained largely undetermined due to the lack of a single-genetic marker resolving all pigment types (PTs). Here, we developed and employed a robust method based on three distinct marker genes (cpcBA, mpeBA, and mpeW) to estimate the relative abundance of all known Synechococcus PTs from metagenomes. Analysis of the Tara Oceans dataset allowed us to reveal the global distribution of Synechococcus PTs and to define their environmental niches. Green-light specialists (PT 3a) dominated in warm, green equatorial waters, whereas blue-light specialists (PT 3c) were particularly abundant in oligotrophic areas. Type IV chromatic acclimaters (CA4-A/B), which are able to dynamically modify their light absorption properties to maximally absorb green or blue light, were unexpectedly the most abundant PT in our dataset and predominated at depth and high latitudes. We also identified populations in which CA4 might be nonfunctional due to the lack of specific CA4 genes, notably in warm high-nutrient low-chlorophyll areas. Major ecotypes within clades I--IV and CRD1 were preferentially associated with a particular PT, while others exhibited a wide range of PTs. Altogether, this study provides important insights into the ecology of Synechococcus and highlights the complex interactions between vertical phylogeny, pigmentation, and environmental parameters that shape Synechococcus community structure and evolution.}

This study investigated whether exposure to bloom-like concentrations of two Synechococcus strains, CC9311 and CC9902, alters fish behaviour. Black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) were exposed to Synechococcus strain CC9311 or CC9902 (1.5\>{\texttimes}\>106\>cells\>ml-1) or to control seawater in experimental aquaria for 3\>days. Fish movement inside a testing arena was then recorded and analysed using video camera-based motion-tracking software. Compared with control fish, fish exposed to CC9311 demonstrated a significant preference for the dark zone of the tank in the light--dark test, which is an indication of increased anxiety. Furthermore, fish exposed to CC9311 also had a statistically significant decrease in velocity and increase in immobility and they meandered more in comparison to control fish. There was a similar trend in velocity, immobility and meandering in fish exposed to CC9902, but there were no significant differences in behaviour or locomotion between this group and control fish. Identical results were obtained with a second batch of fish. Additionally, in this second trial we also investigated whether fish would recover after a 3\>day period in seawater without cyanobacteria. Indeed, there were no longer any significant differences in behaviour among treatments, demonstrating that the sp. CC9311-induced alteration of behaviour is reversible. These results demonstrate that blooms of specific marine Synechococcus strains can induce differential sublethal effects in fish, namely alterations light--dark preference behaviour and motility.},

  abstract = {Synechococcus is a cosmopolitan genus of picocyanobacteria living in the photic zone of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon. This separation was largely consistent with the phycobiliprotein composition of the different BSea strains. The majority of phycocyanin (PC)-rich Bsea strains clustered with WH5701. Remarkably, the phycoerythrin (PE)-rich strains of BSea formed an as yet unidentified cluster within the cpcBA phylogeny, distantly related to other PE-rich groups. Detailed analysis of the cpcBA operon using neighbour-net analysis indicated that the PE-rich BSea strains are probably endemic for the Baltic Sea. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained by the 16S rRNA-ITS, the cpcBA, and the concatenated 16S rRNA-ITS and cpcBA operon sequences revealed possible events of horizontal gene transfer among different Synechococcus lineages. Our results show that microdiversity is important in Synechococcus populations and that it can reflect extensive diversification of different pigmentation phenotypes into different ecological niches.},

A total of ten pigment groups were considered to represent three Phytoplankton Size Classes (PSCs, micro-, nano- and picoplankton) and seven Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs, i.e. diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, prymnesiophytes (haptophytes), pico-eukaryotes, prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.). The observed relationships between Chl-a and PSCs/PFTs were well-defined at the global scale to show that a community shift of phytoplankton at the basin and global scales is reflected by a change in Chl-a of the total community. Thus, Chl-a of the total community can be used as an index of not only phytoplankton biomass but also of their community structure. Within these relationships, we also found non-monotonic variations with Chl-a for certain pico-sized phytoplankton (pico-eukaryotes, Prokaryotes and Prochlorococcus sp.) and nano-sized phytoplankton (Green algae, prymnesiophytes). The relationships were quantified with a least-square fitting approach in order to enable an estimation of the PFTs from Chl-a where PFTs are expressed as a percentage of the total Chl-a. The estimated uncertainty of the relationships depends on both PFT and Chl-a concentration. Maximum uncertainty of 31.8\% was found for diatoms at Chl-a = 0.49 mg m-3. However, the mean uncertainty of the relationships over all PFTs was 5.9\% over the entire Chl-a range observed in situ (0.02 \&lt; Chl-a \&lt; 4.26 mg m\&minus;3). The relationships were applied to SeaWiFS satellite Chl-a data from 1998 to 2009 to show the global climatological fields of the surface distribution of PFTs. Results show that microplankton are present in the mid and high latitudes, constituting only {\textasciitilde}10.9\% of the entire phytoplankton community in the mean field for 1998--2009, in which diatoms explain {\textasciitilde}7.5\%. Nanoplankton are ubiquitous throughout the global surface oceans, except the subtropical gyres, constituting {\textasciitilde}45.5\%, of which prymnesiophytes (haptophytes) are the major group explaining {\textasciitilde}31.7\% while green algae contribute {\textasciitilde}13.9\%. Picoplankton are dominant in the subtropical gyres, but constitute {\textasciitilde}43.6\% globally, of which prokaryotes are the major group explaining {\textasciitilde}26.5\% (Prochlorococcus sp. explaining 22.8\%), while pico-eukaryotes explain {\textasciitilde}17.2\% and are relatively abundant in the South Pacific. These results may be of use to evaluate global marine ecosystem models.},

Carbon-specific uptake rates equalled cell specific growth rates for a minimum of 3 h at high light intensity (636 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}). Low molecular weight (LMW) compounds were linearly labelled for up to 4 h under constant high light and accounted for nearly 70 \% of total {$^{14}$}C fixed. Chloroform-soluble (lipid) and TCA-soluble (polysaccharide) fractions were uniformly labelled for only 2 h, accounting for 9 to 15 \% of total {$^{14}$}C fixed. Under low light intensity (30 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$}), the proportion of {$^{14}$}C decreased in the LMW, chloroform-soluble and TCA-soluble fractions, but increased in particulate materials relative to that occurring at high light. There was an increase in the carbon fixation rates of LMW, chloroform-soluble, and particulate fractions when these cells were re-exposed to high light; carbon partitioning into the TCA-soluble fraction was initially suppressed, but recovered within 30 to 60 min. After 2 h of alternating 30 min exposures to high and low light, cells lost the ability to maintain a carbon fixation rate at 636 {$\mu$}E m{$^{-2}$} s{$^{-1}$} equivalent to that found in control cultures. Carbon fixation into LMW, chloroform-soluble, and TCA-soluble fractions under fluctuating irradiance occurred only at high light, while protein labeling was unaffected. Based on these metabolic patterns, it appears that short-term (15 to 30 min) light fluctuations in situ may have a major influence on the pattern of carbon partitioning in marine phytoplankton.}

Two pre-acclimation regimes were used, Vita-Lite as controls (530-- 700 nm peak) and blue light as experimentals (430-- 460 nm peak) prior to the mating experiments. In blue light, an increase in the number of matings and spherical cells (spheres) produced in the life cycle was observed as the photoperiod increased. This implies that longer photoperiods of blue light are more optimal for sexual reproduction in Chloromonas sp.-D than shorter ones. Under Vita-Lite, there was a significant increase in the number of matings and spheres with the extended 20 : 4 photoperiod compared with the shorter 14 : 10 photoperiod. Under blue light, significantly more matings and spheres occurred than under Vita-Lite using the same irradiance level of 95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1 (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR] of 400-- 700 nm) for the 14 : 10 and 20 : 4 photoperiods. The results of these experiments suggest that Chloromonas sp.-D, known only from the Tughill Plateau, NY, is not reproducing optimally at this site where it grows and reproduces under an approximate 14 : 10 photoperiod in early April. However, in the upper 10 cm of snow in the Tughill Plateau, a blue light irradiance level of 95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1 occurs, which is optimal for this species. When these conditions are combined with a 14 : 10 photoperiod, the Tughill Plateau appears to be sub-optimal for mating and production of spherical cells. Since Chloromonas sp.-D does not appear to have a dependence on a dark cycle, this would allow it to expand its geographical distribution. It may reproduce more optimally under blue light (95{\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1) with an extended photoperiod ({$>$}20 : 4 h, light:dark) in high latitude field sites such as Lake Bienville, Qu{\'e}bec, in eastern North America where other species of Chloromonas are known in snow associated with coniferous forests.

Previous work suggested that these absorption properties of water create a series of spectral niches but the theory was still too simplified to enable prediction of the spectral niches in real aquatic ecosystems. Here, we show with a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model that the vibrational modes of the water molecule delineate five spectral niches, in the violet, blue, green, orange and red parts of the spectrum. These five niches are effectively captured by chlorophylls and phycobilin pigments of cyanobacteria and their eukaryotic descendants. Global distributions of the spectral niches are predicted by satellite remote sensing and validated with observed large-scale distribution patterns of cyanobacterial pigment types. Our findings provide an elegant explanation for the biogeographical distributions of photosynthetic pigments across the lakes and oceans of our planet.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis. Yet, most phytoplankton species are heavier than water and therefore sink. How can these sinking species persist? Somehow, the answer should lie in the turbulent motion that redisperses sinking phytoplankton over the vertical water column. Here, we show, using a reaction-advection-diffusion equation of light-limited phytoplankton, that there is a turbulence window sustaining sinking phytoplankton species in deep waters. If turbulent diffusion is too high, phytoplankton are mixed to great depths, and the depth-averaged light conditions are too low to allow net positive population growth. Conversely, if turbulent diffusion is too low, sinking phytoplankton populations end up at the ocean floor and succumb in the dark. At intermediate levels of turbulent diffusion, however, phytoplankton populations can outgrow both mixing rates and sinking rates. In this way, the reproducing population as a whole can maintain a position in the well-lit zone near the top of the water column, even if all individuals within the population have a tendency to sink. This theory unites earlier classic results by Sverdrup and Riley as well as our own recent findings and provides a new conceptual framework for the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics under the influence of mixing processes.},

It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic phenotyping requires quick characterization of dynamic traits when measuring large plant numbers in a fluctuating environment. Here, we evaluated the light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) method for its capacity to yield rapidly fluorometric parameters from 0.6~m distance. The close approximation of LIFT to conventional chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) parameters is shown under controlled conditions in spinach leaves and isolated thylakoids when electron transport was impaired by anoxic conditions or chemical inhibitors. The ChlF rise from minimum fluorescence (Fo) to maximum fluorescence induced by fast repetition rate (Fm-FRR) flashes was dominated by reduction of the primary electron acceptor in photosystem II (QA). The subsequent reoxidation of QA- was quantified using the relaxation of ChlF in 0.65~ms (Fr1) and 120~ms (Fr2) phases. Reoxidation efficiency of QA- (Fr1/Fv, where Fv~=~Fm-FRR\,-\,Fo) decreased when electron transport was impaired, while quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) showed often no significant effect. ChlF relaxations of the LIFT were similar to an independent other method. Under increasing light intensities, Fr2{$\prime$}/Fq{$\prime$} (where Fr2{$\prime$} and Fq{$\prime$} represent Fr2 and Fv in the light-adapted state, respectively) was hardly affected, whereas the operating efficiency of photosystem II (Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) decreased due to non-photochemical quenching. Fm-FRR was significantly lower than the ChlF maximum induced by multiple turnover (Fm-MT) flashes. However, the resulting Fv/Fm and Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} from both flashes were highly correlated. The LIFT method complements Fv/Fm with information about efficiency of electron transport. Measurements in situ and from a distance facilitate application in high-throughput and automated phenotyping.},

  abstract = {Cell division of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and other phytoplankton typically becomes entrained to diel light/dark cycles under laboratory conditions, with division occurring primarily during dark phases and production occurring during light phases. Under these conditions, increases in cell and biomass concentrations deviate from exponential functions on time scales {$<$} 24 h. These deviations lead to significant diel variations in common measurements of phytoplankton physiology such as cellular quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon (POC, PIC) and their production rates. Being time-dependent, only the temporal mean of the various values during the day are comparable between experiments. Deviations from exponential growth furthermore imply that increases in cell and biomass concentrations cannot be expressed by the daily growth rate {$\mu$}24 h (typically determined from daily increments in cell concentrations). Consequently, conventional calculations of production as the product of a cellular quota (e.g., POC quota) and {$\mu$}24 h are mathematically incorrect. To account for this, we here describe short-term changes in cell and biomass concentrations of fast-dividing, dilute-batch cultures of E. huxleyi grown under a diel light/dark cycle using linear regression. Based on the derived models, we present calculations for daily means of cellular quotas and production rates. Conventional (time-specific) measurements of cellular quotas and production differ from daily means by up to 65\% in our example and, under some circumstances, cause false ``effects'' of treatments. Intending to reduce errors in ecophysiological studies, we recommend determining daily means---mathematically or by adjusting the experimental setup or sampling times appropriately.},

The green microalgae examined differ in the reproduction mode. Continuous illumination stimulated the growth of B.~braunii and S.~obliquus more effectively than the growth of the microalgal species from the genus Neochloris. However, under shorter duration of light of the same intensity (12L:12D cycle), the growth of all the three species of Neochloris was stimulated. Under continuous illumination, the specific growth rate in the first phase of B.~braunii and S.~obliquus cultures was higher than the growth rate of Neochloris, whereas under the 12L:12D cycle, the specific growth rate of all the three Neochloris species was generally higher than that in B.~braunii and S.~obliquus. As a result, the light regime influenced algal biomass productivity differently. The maximum biomass productivity was obtained in B. braunii and S. obliquus cultures carried out at continuous illumination. All the Neochloris species produced biomass more efficiently at the 12L:12D cycle, which was two--threefold higher than that of B. braunii and S. obliquus. The unicellular species of the green microalgae from the genus Neochloris, examined for the first time in this study, are promising prospective objects for algal biotechnology.},

  abstract = {The pelagic sunlit zone or euphotic zone is defined as the lit surface of the ocean down to a depth where enough light penetrates to allow photosynthesis. Typically, the depth at which photosynthesis still exceeds respiration coincides with the depth at which the light intensity is attenuated to 1\% of the sea surface irradiance. The composition of the light-dependent pelagic microbiome is both a function of light availability and spectral quality, as well as the strength of the water column stratification relative to turbulent mixing. Solar radiation provides the energy source for the pelagic light-dependent microbiome. However, additional environmental factors affecting the surface layer of the ocean make this environment spatially and temporally variable. Latitude has a combined effect on photoperiod, seasonal light levels, and temperature regimes. Overall, the microbiome inhabiting the euphotic zone in the ocean is adapted to steep gradients in light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations that can occur on local spatial scales. The three main categories of microorganisms that conserve energy from sunlight are the cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae who carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, the aerobic anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (AAnPB) that perform photoheterotrophy, and proteorhodopsin-containing bacteria which synthesize ATP via a light-driven proton pump. Organisms within all three groups are taxonomically diverse and are adapted to cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions. Although the energy flow through the euphotic zone is controlled by primary producers that carry out carbon fixation via oxygenic photosynthesis, the microbiome in this layer of the ocean is additionally composed of heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and symbiotic microorganisms who interact with primary producers either in a predatory role or as nutrient recyclers.},

To understand the phytoplankton photophysiological responses to these environmental changes, we evaluated photoacclimation strategies of phytoplankton during the low-light, high-nutrient, ice-covered spring and the high-light, low-nutrient, ice-free summer. Field results show that phytoplankton effectively acclimated to reduced irradiance beneath the sea ice by maximizing light absorption and photosynthetic capacity. In fact, exceptionally high maximum photosynthetic rates and efficiency observed during the spring demonstrate that abundant nutrients enable prebloom phytoplankton to become ``primed'' for increases in irradiance. This ability to quickly exploit increasing irradiance can help explain the ability of phytoplankton to generate massive blooms beneath sea ice. In comparison, phytoplankton growth and photosynthetic rates are reduced postbloom due to severe nutrient limitation. These results advance our knowledge of photoacclimation by polar phytoplankton in extreme environmental conditions and indicate how phytoplankton may acclimate to future changes in light and nutrient resources under continued climate change.},

Here, we assessed the effects of N and Fe amendments on both photosynthesis and biomass of phytoplankton (including final chlorophyll a biomass and taxonomic composition) in that region. Overall, the carrying capacity of phytoplankton biomass was primarily constrained by N, and Fe was a limiting resource only near the equator where phytoplankton was co-limited by N and Fe. Positive growth responses in nutrient-receiving treatments were predominantly caused by diatoms, sometimes together with Synechococcus. The often strong stimulation of large phytoplankton in these treatments substantially modified the phytoplankton assemblage from picoplankton- to diatom-dominated, which was often accompanied by a significant increase in photosynthetic competence. This is the first report showing that phytoplankton in the tropical western North Pacific are primarily limited by N, and co-limited by Fe in some areas. We combined our results with those from comparable studies in the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean to propose a general typology that describes and predicts the long-term effects of rate-limiting N and Fe on phytoplankton final biomass and changes in community structure.}

Although they require solar energy for photosynthesis, excess light and associated high UV radiations can induce high levels of oxidative stress that may have deleterious effects on their growth and productivity. Here, we compared the photophysiologies of the model strains Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803 grown under a bell-shaped light/dark cycle of high visible light supplemented or not with UV. Prochlorococcus exhibited a higher sensitivity to photoinactivation than Synechococcus under both conditions, as shown by a larger drop of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield at noon and different diel patterns of the D1 protein pool. In the presence of UV, the PSII repair rate was significantly depressed at noon in Prochlorococcus compared to Synechococcus. Additionally, Prochlorococcus was more sensitive than Synechococcus to oxidative stress, as shown by the different degrees of PSII photoinactivation after addition of hydrogen peroxide. A transcriptional analysis also revealed dramatic discrepancies between the two organisms in the diel expression patterns of several genes involved notably in the biosynthesis and/or repair of photosystems, light-harvesting complexes, CO2 fixation as well as protection mechanisms against light, UV, and oxidative stress, which likely translate profound differences in their light-controlled regulation. Altogether our results suggest that while Synechococcus has developed efficient ways to cope with light and UV stress, Prochlorococcus cells seemingly survive stressful hours of the day by launching a minimal set of protection mechanisms and by temporarily bringing down several key metabolic processes. This study provides unprecedented insights into understanding the distinct depth distributions and dynamics of these two picocyanobacteria in the field.},

PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({\textpm}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

Chlorophyll-specific and carbon-specific absorption coefficients of the algae were monitored, allowing changes in the quantum yield for growth ({$\Phi$}{\textmu}) to be assessed. All the parameters appear to be practically unaffected by chromatic conditions, provided that the photosynthetically usable radiation (PUR) is made equal. Diatoms respond to the energy level whatever the color. Nevertheless, due to opposite influences of the modifications in the ``package'' effect and in the C : Chl a ratio ({$\Theta$}), the light-harvesting capabilities of the living carbon pool vary only weakly. Therefore the growth rate change (from 0.3 to 1.2 d-1) is essentially governed by the change in {$\Phi$}{\textmu} (from 0.01 to 0.052 mol C retained mol-1 quanta absorbed). The kinetics of the Chl-a-per-cell modification and of the {$\Phi$}{\textmu} response is rather fast (within approximately one generation). Quantum yield for growth is halved after a transfer to high irradiance; thereafter it remains low and steady. Conversely the enhanced value observed just after transfer to low irradiance is not maintained beyond 2 or 3 d; after that, {$\Phi$}{\textmu} is restored practically to its initial value.},

  abstract = {Recent studies by Morel (1978) and Platt, Sathyendranath, Caverhill and Lewis (1988) have demonstrated the relative stability of the relationship between available photosynthetic energy at the ocean surface and energy stored by algal photosynthesis, once it has been normalized with respect to the column integrated chlorophyll biomass. Therefore the cross section via a vis photosynthesis and per unit of areal chlorophyll, {$\psi\ast$}, in m2 (g Chl)-1, should be relatively stable in spite of the various environmental and trophic situations possibly encountered in the open ocean. Such an ecological or biogeochemical ``constant'' is of importance when trying to transform biomass maps (obtained from remotely sensed ocean colour data) into primary production maps. Its approximate constancy has to be understood and deserves analysis. This analysis rests on the use of the local and instantaneous growth rate equation (Kiefer and Mitchell, 1983) which has to be triply integrated with respect to wavelength, depth and time. Such an integration is, in effect, the core of a light production model which schematically includes the following steps: 1.(i) to compute as a function of the sun elevation for various days, latitudes and atmospheric conditions (aerosols, water vapour, etc.) the photosynthetic energy impinging at the ocean surface (direct and diffuse components);2.(ii) to account for the loss by reflection at the air-sea interface;3.(iii) to propagate this radiant energy (in terms of spectral scalar irradiance) throughout the water column and according to given pigment vertical profiles;4.(iv) to evaluate what part of energy is absorbed by algae within the productive column;5.(v) and finally to compute that part of absorbed energy which is stored in the form of organic carbon added to the initial biomass; this last step implies that the yield for growth be modelled as a function of the irradiance level and temperature. Sensitivity tests have been effected with respect not only to the physical parameters which can be accurately modelled, but also with respect to the physiological factors for which values and parameterisation are more uncertain. Non-linear and interactive influences cause the {$\psi\ast$} values obtained by running the model, to vary within a rather restricted range (within a factor 2, for most of the trophic and environmental conditions), which are similar to those resulting from field studies. The variability of the biomass-normalized primary production can be explained and the seasonal or zonal trends illustrated. The effect of cloudiness is also analysed. This spectral light --- photosynthesis model (a sub model in the more general study of the biomass evolution) can be used either to reproduce primary production experiments and also as a predictive tool in the oceanic carbon fixation problem. The global scale made accessible by satellite techniques requires that a climatological field of the {$\psi\ast$} parameter be produced. This can be done by operating the present model, provided that the physiological factors which intervene are sufficiently ascertained and adequately parameterised, and also provided that the vertical distibution of the algal biomass can be inferred from the partial information (restricted to the upper layer) delivered by ocean colour sensors.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to review and tentatively to interpret the optical behavior of oceanic case I waters, those waters for which phytoplankton and their derivative play a predominant role in determining their optical properties. Chlorophyll-like pigment concentration is used as the index to quantify the algal material (living and detrital), and statistical relationships between this index and the depth of the euphotic layer, the spectral values of the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, or the scattering coefficient are investigated. On the basis of these statistical relationships a pigment-dependent optical model is developed. It allows the propagation of the visible radiant energy within the ocean or the backscattered radiation from the upper layer to be predicted as a function of the local phytoplanktonic content. Other geophysical or geochemical applications are derived which concern the heating rate due to penetrating visible radiations or the rate of energy storage due to photosynthesis. The nonlinear trends observed in the algal biomass-attenuation relationships are analyzed by (1) considering the rather regular change of the living-to-detrital organic carbon ratio which seems to occur in oceanic waters ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and (2) accounting for the respective contributions of absorption (by pigmented cells) and of scattering (by all kind of particulates) in the attenuation process of radiant energy.},

Phycobiliproteins typically accounted for about 50\% total cell protein, the prevalent type being C-phycocyanin, followed by alloppycocyanin, with levels of 17 and 11\% d.wt, respectively, in some strains of Anabaena and Nostoc. C-phycoerythrin was the major pigment in several Nostoc strains, reaching 10\% d.wt. Some strains represent, therefore, excellent sources of one or more phycobiliproteins. All strains tolerated an irradiance of ca 2000 {\textmu}mol photon m-2 s-1. Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047 and Nostoc sp. (Albufera) exhibited the widest optimum range of both temperature (30--45 and 25--40 {$^\circ$}C) and pH (6.5--9.5 and 6.0--9.0) for growth, the former also showing significant salt tolerance. In an outdoor open system, productivity of cultures of two phycoerythrin-rich strains of Nostoc was over 20 g (d.wt) m-2 d-1 during summer. The growth performance of the allophycocyanin-rich Anabaena sp. ATCC 33047 in outdoor semi-continuous culture has been assessed throughout the year. Productivity values under optimized conditions ranged from 9 (winter) to 24 (summer) g (d.wt) m-2 d-1.},

Triplicate seawater samples were incubated with and without mitomycin C and the abundances of heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria, total viruses and infectious cyanophage were followed over 24 h. Addition of mitomycin C led to increases in total viral abundance as well as the abundance of cyanophages infecting Synechococcus strain DC2. Given typical estimates of burst size, these increases were consistent with 80\% of the heterotrophic bacteria and 0.6\% of Synechococcus cells being inducible by the addition of mitomycin C. This is the highest percentage of lysogens reported for a natural microbial community and demonstrates induction in a marine Synechococcus population. It is likely that the cyanophage production following the addition of mitomycin C was much higher than that titered against a single strain of Synechococcus; hence this estimate is a minimum. In untreated seawater samples, lytic viral production was estimated to remove ca. 27\% of the gross heterotrophic bacterial production, and a minimum of 1.0\% of the gross cyanobacterial production. Our results demonstrate very high levels of lysogeny in the heterotrophic bacterial community, outside of an oligotrophic environment, and the presence of inducible lysogens in Synechococcus spp. during a naturally occurring bloom. These data emphasize the need for further examination of the factors influencing lytic and lysogenic viral infection in natural microbial communities.}

  abstract = {The prototype light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) instrument provides continuous, minimally intrusive, high time resolution ({\textasciitilde}2\,s) assessment of photosynthetic performance in terrestrial plants from up to 2\,m. It induces a chlorophyll fluorescence transient by a series of short flashes in a saturation sequence (180 {\textasciitilde}1{$\mu$}s flashlets in {$<$}380\,{$\mu$}s) to achieve near-full reduction of the primary acceptor QA, followed by a relaxation sequence (RQA; 90 flashlets at exponentially increasing intervals over {\textasciitilde}30\,ms) to observe kinetics of QA re-oxidation. When fitted by the fast repetition rate (FRR) model (Kolber et al. 1998) the QA flash of LIFT/FRR gives smaller values for FmQA from dark adapted leaves than FmPAM from pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) assays. The ratio FmQA/FmPAM resembles the ratio of fluorescence yield at the J/P phases of the classical O-J-I-P transient and we conclude that the difference simply is due to the levels of PQ pool reduction induced by the two techniques. In a strong PAM-analogous WL pulse in the dark monitored by the QA flash of LIFT/FRR {$\varphi$}PSIIWL {$\approx$} {$\varphi$}PSIIPAM. The QA flash also tracks PQ pool reduction as well as the associated responses of ETR QA {$\rightarrow$} PQ and PQ {$\rightarrow$} PSI, the relative functional ({$\sigma$}PSII) and optical absorption (aPSII) cross-sections of PSII in situ with a time resolution of {\textasciitilde}2\,s as they relax after the pulse. It is impractical to deliver strong WL pulses at a distance in the field but a longer PQ flash from LIFT/FRR also achieves full reduction of PQ pool and delivers {$\varphi$}PSIIPQ {$\approx$} {$\varphi$}PSIIPAM to obtain PAM-equivalent estimates of ETR and NPQ at a distance. In situ values of {$\sigma$}PSII and aPSII from the QA flash with smaller antenna barley (chlorina-f2) and Arabidopsis mutants (asLhcb2--12, ch1--3 Lhcb5) are proportionally similar to those previously reported from in vitro assays. These direct measurements are further validated by changes in antenna size in response to growth irradiance. We illustrate how the QA flash facilitates our understanding of photosynthetic regulation during sun flecks in natural environments at a distance, with a time resolution of a few seconds.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton primary productivity is most commonly measured by 14C assimilation although less direct methods, such as O2 exchange, have also been employed. These methods are invasive, requiring bottle incubation for up to 24 h. As an alternative, Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) has been used, on wide temporal and spatial scales within aquatic systems, to estimate photosystem II (PSII) electron flux per unit volume (JVPSII), which generally correlates well with photosynthetic O2 evolution. A major limitation of using FRRf arises from the need to employ an independent method to determine the concentration of functional photosystem II reaction centers ([RCII]); a requirement that has prevented FRR fluorometers being used, as stand-alone instruments, for the estimation of electron transport. Within this study, we have taken a new approach to the analysis of FRRf data, based on a simple hypothesis; that under a given set of environmental conditions, the ratio of rate constants for RCII fluorescence emission and photochemistry falls within a narrow range, for all groups of phytoplankton. We present a simple equation, derived from the established FRRf algorithm, for determining [RCII] from dark FRRf data alone. We also describe an entirely new algorithm for estimating JVPSII, which does not require determination of [RCII] and is valid for a heterogeneous model of connectivity among RCIIs. Empirical supporting evidence is presented. These data are derived from FRR measurements across a diverse range of microalgae, in parallel with independent measurements of [RCII]. Possible sources of error, particularly under nutrient stress conditions, are discussed.},

Of particular value are qP, which quantifies the photochemical capacity of photosystem II, and Fv-;/Fm-;, which quantifies the extent to which photochemistry at photosystem II is limited by competition with thermal decay processes. Imaging of both qP and Fv-;/Fm-; requires measurement of Fo-; (the minimum fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state), which cannot be imaged with existing systems.

In this study, the physiological properties of the long-term nitrogen-starved cells are investigated in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of maintenance of viability. Preservation of energetic homeostasis is based on a low level of residual photosynthesis; activities of photosystem II and photosystem I were approximately 0.1\% of activities of vegetatively growing cells. The low levels of photosystem I activity were measured by a novel colorimetric assay developed from the activity staining of ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Photosystem II reaction centers, as determined by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, exhibited normal properties, although the efficiency of light harvesting was significantly reduced compared with that of control cells. Long-term chlorotic cells carried out protein synthesis at a very low, but detectable level, as revealed by in vivo [35S]methionine labeling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In conjunction with the very low levels of total cellular protein contents, this implies a continuous protein turnover during chlorosis. Synthesis of components of the photosynthetic apparatus could be detected, whereas factors of the translational machinery were stringently down-regulated. Beyond the massive loss of protein during acclimation to nitrogen deprivation, two proteins that were identified as SomA and SomB accumulated due to an induced expression following nitrogen reduction.},

Prochlorococcus was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. The genus comprises specific ecotypes which are phylogenetically distinct and differ markedly in their photophysiology, allowing growth over a broad range of light and nutrient conditions within the 45{$^\circ$}N to 40{$^\circ$}S latitudinal belt that they occupy. Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are closely related, together forming a discrete picophytoplankton clade, but are distinguishable by their possession of dissimilar light-harvesting apparatuses and differences in cell size and elemental composition. Synechococcus strains have a ubiquitous oceanic distribution compared to that of Prochlorococcus strains and are characterized by phylogenetically discrete lineages with a wide range of pigmentation. In this review, we put our current knowledge of marine picocyanobacterial genomics into an environmental context and present previously unpublished genomic information arising from extensive genomic comparisons in order to provide insights into the adaptations of these marine microbes to their environment and how they are reflected at the genomic level.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are known to have unique capability of nitrogen fixation in their specialized cell known as heterocyst. However, differentiation of vegetative cell toward heterocyst reduces competitive ability of cyanobacteria because it led to a shift of energy allocation from carbon to nitrogen metabolism. Therefore, heterocyst formation is regulated to avoid the differentiation commitment due to short-term nitrogen fluctuation. Once nitrogen deficiency signal is sensed by the cyanobacteria, pattern of heterocyst formation is determined that ensures equidistance formation of heterocyst cells with about one heterocyst per ten vegetative cells. After differentiation, heterocyst provides anaerobic condition that is prerequisite for the nitrogenase complex to fix the atmospheric dinitrogen. Microoxic condition inside the heterocyst is attained by elimination of oxygen-producing photosystem II activity, increasing respiration rate, and by formation of thick heterocyst-specific exopolysaccharide and glycolipid layer. Nitrogen-fixing machinery is assembled and activated during heterocyst differentiation. The nitrogenase complex is encoded by nif gene family. Many of these genes are interrupted in the vegetative cells by interruption elements and these are excised during differentiation of heterocyst by a site-specific recombinase, leading to the activation of genes. In this chapter, we have outlined the molecular circuit of heterocyst differentiation and discussed the assembly of nitrogen-fixing machinery and role of key enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism in the cyanobacteria.},

An upward fluctuation in irradiance can result in photosystem II photoinactivation exceeding counteracting repair rates through protein turnover, thereby leading to net photoinhibition of primary productivity, and potentially cell death. Here we show that the effective cross-section for photosystem II photoinactivation is conserved across the picocyanobacteria, but that their photosystem II repair capacity and protein-specific photosystem II light capture are negatively correlated and vary widely across the strains. The differences in repair rate correspond to the light and nutrient conditions that characterize the site of origin of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus isolates, and determine the upward fluctuation in irradiance they can tolerate, indicating that photoinhibition due to transient high-light exposure influences their distribution in the ocean.},

  abstract = {The most ubiquitous cyanobacteria, Synechococcus, have colonized different marine thermal niches through the evolutionary specialization of lineages adapted to different ranges of temperature seawater. We used the strains of Synechococcus temperature ecotypes to study how light utilization has evolved in the function of temperature. The tropical Synechococcus (clade II) was unable to grow under 16 {$^\circ$}C but, at temperatures {$>$}25 {$^\circ$}C, induced very high growth rates that relied on a strong synthesis of the components of the photosynthetic machinery, leading to a large increase in photosystem cross-section and electron flux. By contrast, the Synechococcus adapted to subpolar habitats (clade I) grew more slowly but was able to cope with temperatures {$<$}10 {$^\circ$}C. We show that growth at such temperatures was accompanied by a large increase of the photoprotection capacities using the orange carotenoid protein (OCP). Metagenomic analyzes revealed that Synechococcus natural communities show the highest prevalence of the ocp genes in low-temperature niches, whereas most tropical clade II Synechococcus have lost the gene. Moreover, bioinformatic analyzes suggested that the OCP variants of the two cold-adapted Synechococcus clades I and IV have undergone evolutionary convergence through the adaptation of the molecular flexibility. Our study points to an important role of temperature in the evolution of the OCP. We, furthermore, discuss the implications of the different metabolic cost of these physiological strategies on the competitiveness of Synechococcus in a warming ocean. This study can help improve the current hypotheses and models aimed at predicting the changes in ocean carbon fluxes in response to global warming.}

  abstract = {The contribution of picocyanobacteria (PCY) to summer phytoplankton blooms, accompanied by an ecological crisis is a new phenomenon in Europe. This issue requires careful investigation. The present study examined the response of Synechococcus sp. physiology to different environmental conditions. Three strains of Synechococcus sp. (red BA-120, green BA-124, and brown BA-132) were cultivated in a laboratory under previously determined environmental conditions. These conditions were as follows: temperature (T) from 10 by 5 to 25\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C, salinity from 3 by 5 to 18 PSU, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from 10 by 90 to 280\&thinsp;{\textmu}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m-2\&thinsp;s-1, which gave 64 combinations of synthetic, though realistic, environmental scenarios. Scenarios reflecting all possible combinations were applied in the laboratory experiments. Results pointed to differences in final numbers of cells among strains. However, there was also a similar tendency for BA-124 and BA-132, which demonstrated the highest concentrations of PCY cells at elevated T and PAR. This was also the case for BA-120 but only to a certain degree as the number of cells started to decrease above 190\&thinsp;{\textmu}mol\&thinsp;photons\&thinsp;m-2\&thinsp;s-1\&thinsp;PAR. Pigmentation, chlorophyll a (Chl a), fluorescence, and rate of photosynthesis presented both similarities and differences among strains. In this context, more consistent features were observed between brown and red strains when compared to the green. In this paper, the ecophysiological responses of PCY are defined.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that the genus Synechococcus is responsible for about 17\% of net primary production in the Global Ocean. Blooms of these organisms are observed in tropical, subtropical and even temperate zones, and they have been recorded recently even beyond the polar circle. The long-term scenarios forecast a growing expansion of Synechococcus sp. and its area of dominance. This is, among others, due to their high physiological plasticity in relation to changing environmental conditions. Three phenotypes of the genus Synechococcus sp. (Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3a) were tested in controlled laboratory conditions in order to identify their response to various irradiance (10, 55, 100 and 145 {\textmu}mol photons m-2 s-1) and temperature (15, 22.5 and 30 {$^\circ$}C) conditions. The highest total pigment content per cell was recorded at 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at all temperature variants with the clear dominance of phycobilins among all the pigments. In almost every variant the highest growth rate was recorded for the Type 1. The lowest growth rates were observed, in general, for the Type 3a. However, it was recognized to be less temperature sensitive in comparison to the other two types and rather light-driven with the highest plasticity and adaptation potential. The highest amounts of carotenoids were produced by Type 2 which also showed signs of the cell stress even around 55 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1 at 15 {$^\circ$}C and 22.5 {$^\circ$}C. This may imply that the Type 2 is the most susceptible to higher irradiances. Picocyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. require less light intensity to achieve the maximum rate of photosynthesis than larger algae. They also tolerate a wide range of temperatures which combined together make them gain a powerful competitive advantage. Our results will provide key information for the ecohydrodynamical model development. Thus, this work would be an important link in forecasting future changes in the occurrence of these organisms in the context of global warming.},

There are over ten various PBP known, which falls into one of three groups: phycoerythrins, phycocyanins, and allophycocyanins. Hollow disks of PBP trimers and hexamers are arranged into cylinders by colorless linker proteins; the cylinders are then assembled into PBS. Typical semidiscoidal PBS consists of a central core formed by three allophycocyanin cylinders and of six lateral cylinders consisting of other PBP and attached as a fan to the nucleus. The PBS number, size, and pigment composition in cyanobacteria depend on light conditions and other ambient factors. While PBSs have certain advantages compared to other antennae, these pigment-protein complexes require more energy for their biosynthesis than the chlorophyll a/b and chlorophyll a/c proteins of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.},

Here we compare simultaneous measurements of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II obtained from the two techniques and independent estimates of the rate of light absorption by photosystem II. We measured the light-dependencies of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) in five phytoplankters using FRR and Xe-PAM approaches. The FRR and PAM estimates were related in a non-linear fashion. At low irradiances, Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} measured using PAM fluorescence exceeded Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} measured using FRR fluorescence by about 20\%. At high irradiances, measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} from the two approaches converged. The differences in Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} reflect the distinct techniques by which FRR and PAM protocols excite PSII and are amplified when estimating electron transfer rates as a result of the irradiance term. We also found that measurements of the effective light absorption cross-section for photosystem II obtained by FRR fluorescence compared well with estimates obtained from measured light absorption and photosynthetic unit size. Finally, we compared the photon efficiency of gross oxygen evolution from measurements of gross oxygen evolution and light absorption ({$\Phi$}PO2 18) with FRR measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}. We found that measurements of Fq{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$} were highly linearly correlated, but were lower by a factor of {$\sim$}1.5, than {$\Phi$}PO2 18.},

The three-dimensional spheroidal-pore model of digital core was established based on mesoscopic mechanical theory. The constitutive relationship of different types of pore microstructure deformation was studied with Eshelby equivalent medium theory, and the effects of pore microstructure on pore volume compressibility under elastic deformation conditions of single and multiple pores of a single type and mixed types of pores were investigated. The results showed that the pore volume compressibility coefficient of digital core is closely related with porosity, pore aspect ratio and volumetric proportions of different types of pores. (1) The compressibility coefficient of prolate ellipsoidal pore is positively correlated with the pore aspect ratio, while that of oblate ellipsoidal pore is negatively correlated with the pore aspect ratio. (2) At the same mean value of pore aspect ratio satisfying Gaussian distribution, the more concentrated the range of pore aspect ratio, the higher the compressibility coefficient of both prolate and oblate ellipsoidal pores will be, and the larger the deformation under the same stress condition. (3) The pore compressibility coefficient increases with porosity. (4) At a constant porosity value, the higher the proportion of oblate ellipsoidal and spherical pores in the rock, the more easier for the rock to deform, and the higher the compressibility coefficient of the rock is, while the higher the proportion of prolate ellipsoidal pores in the rock, the more difficult it is for rock to deform, and the lower the compressibility coefficient of the rock is. By calculating pore compressibility coefficient of ten classical digital rock samples, the presented analytical elliptical-pore model based on real pore structure of digital rocks can be applied to calculation of pore volume compressibility coefficient of digital rock sample.},

(CCMP 839), Pelagomonas calceolata (CCMP 1756) and Prasinomonas capsulatus (CCMP 1617) in order to collect physiological parameters for pico-phytoplankton to be utilised in Ocean Biogeochemical Climate Models. The main parameters to follow the effects of ammonium, phosphate, iron and light limitation were cell growth rates ({$\mu$}), half saturation constants for growth (Km), N, P and Fe quota (per cell or per mol C), and photochemical quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm). The nitrate and phosphate limitation experiments demonstrated that the small phytoplankton species could grow at low N and P concentrations. Km values were in the micro-molar (NH4+) and sub-micro-molar (PO43-) range. N and P quota were in the femto-molar range per cell and varied from nutrient-deplete to nutrient-replete conditions. Fv/Fm values were only adversely affected at the lowest N and P concentrations in these experiments. In the Fe limitation experiments, it was shown that all three species were adversely affected only at extremely low Fe concentrations. Iron chelating agents had to be added to force the species in Fe limitation till ultimately growth stopped. Km values with respect to dissolved Fe were in the femto-molar range. Fe quota were in the low zepto-molar (10-21 M) range per cell, and varied considerably from Fe limiting to Fe replete growth conditions. Fv/Fm values diminished only at the lowest iron concentrations. In the light limitation experiments, growth rates and photochemical quantum efficiencies were adversely affected only at irradiance levels below 10 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These results indicate that the pico-phytoplankton species will hardly ever be completely stopped in their growth by NH4+, PO43-, Fe or light (separately) under natural conditions.},

  abstract = {1. We studied the seasonal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in a turbid, large shallow lake during an annual period (2005--06). We relate the patterns of seston concentration (total suspended solids), phytoplankton biomass and water transparency to the seasonal pattern of incident solar radiation (I0). We also report the seasonal trends of phytoplankton primary production (PP) and photosynthesis photoinhibition due to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (I{$\beta$} and UV50). 2. We first collected empirical evidence that indicated the conditions of light limitation persisted during the study period. We found that the depth-averaged irradiance estimated for the time of the day of maximum irradiance (Imean--noon) was always lower than the measured onset of light saturation of photosynthesis (Ik). 3. We then contrasted the observations with theoretical expectations based on a light limitation scenario. The observed temporal patterns of seston concentration, both on a volume and area basis, were significantly explained by I0 (R2 = 0.39 and R2 = 0.37 respectively). The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (kdPAR) (R2 = 0.55) and the depth-averaged irradiance (Imean) (R2 = 0.66), significantly increased with the I0; while the irradiance reaching the lake bottom (Iout) significantly decreased with the incident irradiance (R2 = 0.49). However, phytoplankton biovolume maxima were not coincident with the time of the year of maximum irradiance. 4. A significant positive relationship was observed between PP estimated on an area basis and I0 (R2 = 0.51, P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, the parameters describing the photosynthetic responses to high irradiances displayed marked seasonal trends. The photosynthesis photoinhibition due to PAR as well as to UV were significantly related to incident solar radiation (PAR: R2 = 0.73; UV: R2 = 0.74). These results suggest adaptation of the phytoplankton community in response to changes in incident solar radiation.},

Molecular analysis of the 16S rRNA gene using Denaturating Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of samples from 8 different lakes and fjords revealed a low diversity of picocyanobacteria affiliated to the genus Synechococcus. In total, 132 short sequences from DGGE bands, clones and strains were obtained. Most of the sequences (83 \%) clustered in two closely related groups that tend to separate according to saline or freshwater conditions. However, some representatives of each OTU were found in different types of habitat, suggesting some degree of tolerance. These results show that picocyanobacteria are widely distributed under a broad range of physical and chemical conditions in the Arctic environment, and that some genotypes may be specialists that occupy specific habitat types},

Taxonomic pigments were used as size class markers of phototroph groups (picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton). Primary production rates were computed using a light photosynthesis model that makes use of the total chlorophyll a (Tchl a) concentration profile as an input variable. New production was estimated as the product of primary production by a pigment-based proxy of the {\textflorin} ratio (new production/total production). For the whole eastern Mediterranean, Tchl a concentration was 20.4 mg m-2, and estimated primary and new production were 0.27 and 0.04 g C m-2 d-1, respectively, when integrated between the surface and the depth of the productive zone (1.5 times the euphotic layer). Nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton (determined from the pigment-derived criteria) were the dominant size classes and contributed to 60 and 27\%, respectively, of Tchl a, while microphytoplankton contributed only to 13\%. Subbasin and, to a certain extent, mesoscale structures (cyclonic and anticyclonic gyres) were exceptions to this general trend. Anticyclonic gyres were characterized by low Tchl a concentrations (18.8{\textpm}4.2 mg m-2, with the lowest value being 12.4 mg m-2) and the highest picophytoplankton contribution (40\% of Tchl a). In contrast, cyclonic gyres contained the highest Tchl a concentration (40.3{\textpm}15.3 mg m-2) with the highest microphytoplankton contribution (up to 26\% of Tchl a). Observations conducted at a mesoscale in the Rhode gyre (cyclonic) region show that the core of the gyre is dominated by microphytoplankton (mainly diatoms), while adjacent areas are characterized by high chlorophyll concentration dominated by picophytoplankton and nanophytoplankton. We estimate that the Rhodes gyre is a zone of enhanced new production, which is 9 times higher than that in adjacent oligotrophic areas of the Levantine basin. Our results confirm the predominance of oligotrophic conditions in the eastern Mediterranean and emphasize the role of subbasin and mesoscale dynamics in driving phytoplankton biomass and composition and, finally, biogeochemical cycling in this area.},

  abstract = {Illumination factors such as length of photoperiod and intensity can affect growth of microalgae and lipid content. In order to optimize microalgal growth in mass culture system and lipid content, the effects of light intensity and photoperiod cycle on the growth of the marine microalgae, Nannochloropsis sp. were studied in batch culture. Nannochloropsis sp. was grown aseptically for 9days at three different light intensities (50, 100 and 200{$\mu$}molm-2s-1) and three different photoperiod cycles (24:0, 18:06 and 12:12h light:dark) at 23{$^\circ$}C cultivation temperature. Under the light intensity of 100{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 and photoperiod of 18h light: 6h dark cycle, Nannochloropsis sp. was found to grow favorably with a maximum cell concentration of 6.5{\texttimes}107cellsmL-1, which corresponds to the growth rate of 0.339d-1 after 8day cultivation and the lipid content was found to be 31.3\%.},

That's great for learning (because you don't want to struggle with data handling while you're learning visualisation), but in real life, datasets hardly ever come in exactly the right structure. To use ggplot2 in practice, you'll need to learn some data wrangling skills. Indeed, in my experience, visualisation is often the easiest part of the data analysis process: once you have the right data, in the right format, aggregated in the right way, the right visualisation is often obvious.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton are at the base of aquatic food webs and of global importance for ecosystem functioning and services. The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect  various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {This study presents an algorithm for globally retrieving chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) from multi-sensor merged ocean color (OC) products or Sentinel-3A (S3) Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data from the GlobColour archive in the frame of the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The retrieved PFTs include diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, green algae and prokaryotic phytoplankton. A previously proposed method to retrieve various phytoplankton pigments, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), is investigated and adapted to retrieve Chl-a concentrations of multiple PFTs using extensive global data sets of in situ pigment measurements and matchups with satellite OC products. The performance of the EOF-based approach is assessed and cross-validated statistically. The retrieved PFTs are compared with those derived from diagnostic pigment analysis (DPA) based on in situ pigment measurements. Results show that the approach predicts well Chl-a concentrations of most of the mentioned PFTs. The performance of the approach is, however, less accurate for prokaryotes, possibly due to their general low variability and small concentration range resulting in a weak signal which is extracted from the reflectance data and corresponding EOF modes. As a demonstration of the approach utilization, the EOF-based fitted models based on satellite reflectance products at nine bands are applied to the monthly GlobColour merged products. Climatological characteristics of the PFTs are also evaluated based on ten years of merged products (2002-2012) through inter-comparisons with other existing satellite derived products on phytoplankton composition including phytoplankton size class (PSC), SynSenPFT, OC-PFT and PHYSAT. Inter-comparisons indicate that most PFTs retrieved by our study agree well with previous corresponding PFT/PSC products, except that prokaryotes show higher Chl-a concentration in low latitudes. PFT dominance derived from our products is in general well consistent with the PHYSAT product. A preliminary experiment of the retrieval algorithm using eleven OLCI bands is applied to monthly OLCI products, showing comparable PFT distributions with those from the merged products, though the matchup data for OLCI are limited both in number and coverage. This study is to ultimately deliver satellite global PFT products for long-term continuous observation, which will be updated timely with upcoming OC data, for a comprehensive understanding of the variability of phytoplankton composition structure at a global or regional scale.},

  abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen are the two most abundant nutrient elements for all living organisms, and their metabolism is tightly coupled. What are the signaling mechanisms that cells use to sense and control the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) metabolic balance following environmental changes? Based on studies in cyanobacteria, it was found that 2-phosphoglycolate derived from the oxygenase activity of Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and 2-oxoglutarate from the Krebs cycle act as the carbon- and nitrogen-starvation signals, respectively, and their concentration ratio likely reflects the status of the C/N metabolic balance. We will present and discuss the regulatory principles underlying the signaling mechanisms, which are likely to be conserved in other photosynthetic organisms. These concepts may also contribute to developments in the field of biofuel engineering or improvements in crop productivity.},

  abstract = {Picophytoplankton are the main primary producers in oligotrophic oceans. They  account for more than 90~\% of the phototrophic biomass. Investigations of picophytoplankton in the central Arctic Ocean region are rare because these waters used to be completely covered with sea ice. Large, newly exposed water areas, however, appeared in the sea ice zone during the summer of 2010. This provided the first opportunity to study the Arctic picophytoplankton community in these newly open surface waters. This study focuses on the picophytoplankton in the areas near the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge and  Makarov Basin. Here, HPLC pigment analysis with CHEMTAX was used to study community populations, and 454 pyrosequencing with bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the dominant genera (species). Both Pearson correlation analysis and canonical correlation analysis were used to study the relationships between the community and environmental factors. We found chlorophyll a concentrations were low (0.05--0.39~{$\mu$}g~l-1), and picophytoplankton dominated these areas. The abundances of picophytoplankton were 1.58~{\texttimes}~106--9.47~{\texttimes}~106~cells~l-1 and made up 44--80~\% of the total chlorophyll a. Prasinophytes made up 0--88~\% of the picoplanktonic chlorophyll a with the following distributions: diatoms (2--80~\%), cyanobacteria (0--20~\%), haptophytes (4--14~\%), and dinoflagellates (2--11~\%). The dominant genera (species) in the picoeukaryotes were Pyramimonas (Pyramimonas gelidicola), Micromonas (Micromonas pusilla), and Phaeocystis. Salinity and latitude were the primary factors controlling the community structure of the picophytoplankton.},

Agardh) Montagne. Experimental conditions included temperatures of 10, 15, 20 and 25{$^\circ$}C and low and high irradiances (65 and 300 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1, respectively). Long and short day lengths (16:8 and 8:16 LD cycles) were also applied at the two irradiances. Growth effects of temperature and irradiance were evident in most algae tested, and there were significant interactions among treatments. Most freshwater red algae had the best growth under low irradiance, confirming the preference of freshwater red algae for low light regimens. In general there was highest growth rate in long days and low irradiance. Growth optima in relation to temperature were species-specific and also varied between low and high irradiances for the same alga. The most significant differences in pigment content were related to temperature, whereas few significant differences could be attributed to variation in irradiance and photoperiod or interactions among the three parameters. The responses were species-specific and also differed for pigments in distinct temperatures, irradiances and photoperiods in the same alga. Phycocyanin was generally more concentrated than phycoerythrin and phycobiliproteins were more concentrated than chlorophyll a. The highest total pigment contents were found in two species typical of shaded habitats: A. hermannii and C. coeruleus. The expected inverse relationship of pigment with irradiance was observed only in C. coeruleus. In general, the most favorable conditions for growth were not coincident with those with highest pigment contents.},
